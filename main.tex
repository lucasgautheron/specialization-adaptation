    How scientists navigate between the need to capitalize on their prior knowledge by specializing, and the urge to adapt to evolving research opportunities? Drawing from diverse perspectives on adaptation, in particular from institutional change and cultural evolution, this paper proposes an unsupervised Bayesian model of the evolution of scientists' research portfolios in response to transformations in their field. The model relies on scientific abstracts and authorship data to evaluate the influence of intellectual, social, and institutional resources on scientists' trajectories within a cohort of $2\,195$ high-energy physicists between 2000 and 2019. Using Optimal Transport, the reallocation of research efforts is shown to be shaped by learning costs, thus enhancing the utility of the scientific capital disseminated among scientists. Two dimensions of social capital, namely ``diversity'' and ``power'', have opposite effects on the magnitude of change in scientists' research interests: while ``diversity'' disrupts and expands research interests, ``power'' stabilizes physicists' research agendas -- as does institutional stability. Social capital plays a more crucial role in shifts between cognitively distant research areas. This contribution paves the way for further investigation of science and scientific communities as adaptative systems.   %Finally, this paper argues for the fruitfulness of combining different perspectives on adaptation, in particular those from cultural evolution and institutional change.

% Ideas for further analyses:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Evaluate effect of institutinal instability (i.e. amount of successive affiliations over the period considered) on change score?
%     \item Evaluate effect of academic age?
%     \item Inspect a few profiles of interest by hand, e.g. most significant shifts from Electroweak sector to Dark matter. Maybe send out emails to these physicists and ask a few questions to understand why they have shifted to new research problems and what allowed them to do so.

% Improvements to the model:

% \begin{itemize}

%     \item Make sure that topics are rather autonomous: e.g., that they are strongly correlated with experiments such that those belong to typically 1 topic at most. 
%     \item Make sure that conclusions not sensitive to number of publications required for each time period. Re-do analyses for different thresholds and check. Although I want to look into committed high-energy physicists, so we cannot just lower the publication threshold. Besides the effect of position stability has been considered

% Further analyses planned:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Plug ``individual knowledge'' as a covariate into the model and see what knowledge enhances certain trajectories/shifts to other research areas

\section{Introduction}

Scientists are subject to conflicting incentives. On the one hand, they must work within the realm of their expertise, where they can most effectively exploit their prior knowledge and compete with peers; this conservative preference for familiar research topics is at the root of specialization. On the other hand, scientists are simultaneously compelled to revise their research agenda to engage with more promising research areas in order to benefit from more exposure or to secure jobs and funding. Thus, in some instances, specialization is at odds with the need to adapt to the decline of certain research opportunities and the growth of new ones. How do scientists navigate the trade-off between specialization (i.e. the concentration of their intellectual resources within a narrow cognitive range) and adaptation (i.e. the need to adjust these resources to new realities)? This conflict differs from the ``essential tension'' between ``tradition'' and ``innovation'' proposed by \citet{Kuhn1997}, or that between ``exploration'' and ``exploitation'' \citep{March1991}, which have both been explored quantitatively in previous works \citep{Foster2015,Jia2017,Aleta2019,Zeng2019,Tripodi2020,Chakresh2023,Feifan2023}%\footnote{See also the sampling-specialization trade-off, in an evolutionary setting \citep{Frankenhuis2011}}
. First, ``adaptation'' is not tantamount to innovation or disruption, for it can be a conformist move (e.g. as a result of a bandwagon effect, \citealt{Fujimura1988}). Moreover,  unlike ``exploration'', adaptation is not identical to a search strategy in a static landscape \citep{Galesic2023}, but rather the convergence towards a new state more congruent with current realities. Disruptions due to breakthroughs in Machine Learning (e.g. generative Large Language Models) or challenges due to climate change make it particularly pressing to understand the factors that enhance scientists' adaptability to changing circumstances. Therefore, the present paper investigates scientists' responses to changes in their field (whether it is driven by epistemic or institutional factors), and the effect of their capital (intellectual, social, or institutional) on their ability to adapt. Drawing insights on adaptation from cultural evolution and institutional change, we develop an unsupervised Bayesian approach to analyze changes in scientists' research agenda while measuring the effect of ``capital'' (intellectual or social) on their individual trajectories. The model is applied to a cohort of high-energy physicists between the years 2000 and 2019, a time during which the historical driver of progress in the field -- particle accelerators -- have been contested by emerging astrophysical experiments, thus transforming the landscape of opportunities.

Our approach reveals trends in the field: the boom of dark matter research -- fueled by migrations away from the physics of neutrinos and the electroweak sector -- and the partial disintegration of string theory into the study of black holes and holographic dualities. More importantly, this analysis also shows that changes in scientists' research portfolios are 
 structured by learning costs, as scientific communities adapting to new circumstances address an Optimal Transport problem by reallocating research efforts efficiently. Moreover, two dimensions of social capital, namely ``diversity'' and ``power'' \citep{Abbasi2014}, have opposite effects on change. While ``diversity'' of social capital (i.e. the extent to which scientists have access to diverse cognitive resources via their collaborators) promotes change and further diversification of scientists' research interests, ``power'' (the size of their network) stabilizes their research interests. Social capital has a stronger effect on transfers between research areas that are more cognitively ``distant''. Furthermore, institutional stability is associated with more conservative research interests. %Finally, by comparing scientists' impact, we show that the turn to dark matter, cosmology and black holes has paid off for physicists with prior commitment in ``string theory \& supergravity'' or neutrino physics.
Overall, we contribute: i) a theoretical account of the features of change in scientists' research interests; ii) a novel methodological approach that introduces a model of scientists' trajectories and measures of intellectual capital, social capital, diversity, and power; and finally, iii) empirical evidence from high-energy physics. More generally, this paper addresses the relative lack of empirical works within the body of literature that investigates science as a cultural evolutionary system \citep{Wu2023}.

In what follows, Sections \ref{sec:review} and \ref{sec:conceptual} summarize previous research and lays out the conceptual background on which the analysis rests, and Section \ref{sec:hep} introduces the context of high-energy physics to which the model is applied. %; and Section \ref{sec:hypotheses} summarises the hypotheses that will be evaluated throughout the paper.
Section \ref{sec:methods} elaborates the methodology: the data (\ref{sec:data}), the topic model approach for measuring authors' research portfolios (\ref{sec:topics}), the proposed measures of intellectual and social ``capital'' (\ref{sec:capital}), and the model of scientists' trajectories (\ref{sec:model}).
Section \ref{sec:results} presents the results: i) the transfers of attention from one research area to another due to changes in the scientific landscape; ii) the structuring role of learning costs in the observed patterns of adaptation (\ref{sec:optimal-transport}), and iii) the effect of capital (intellectual and social) and position stability on physicists' strategies (\ref{sec:magnitude}). %Finally, we explore the outcome of scientists' trajectories in terms of citations (\ref{sec:outcomes}) as evidence for the incentives they receive to adapt and the relative payoffs of different strategies. 


\subsection{\label{sec:review}Empirical background}

Changes in scientists' research interests have been studied in previous works. For instance, by mapping the trajectories of 103,246 physicists over 26 years using the \gls{aps} dataset and its topic classification (the \gls{pacs}), \citet{Aleta2019} demonstrated that a majority of physicists gradually migrate to entirely different topics by the end of their careers while often staying within the same general area. They reveal differences between subfields of physics, such that ``exploitation'' (i.e. specialization, as opposed to the ``exploration'' of new topics) is especially prevalent in particle physics.  Using the same data, \citet{Jia2017} instead find an exponentially decaying distribution of changes in scientists' interests. %They also find that physicists tend to investigate a few core topics quite frequently, as well as many ``peripheral'' topics less frequently. %They show that physicists are more likely to investigate topics that they have worked on recently, or topics more similar to those they have previously explored.
%According to them, the observed distribution of changes in research interests can be qualitatively reproduced by a model in which scientists draw combinations of ideas from a gradually drifting pool of topics.
Previous works generally agree, however, on the graduality of change in research topics \citep{Jia2017,Aleta2019,Zeng2019}, as previously observed by  \citet{Gieryn1978}. Recognizing that scientists typically investigate several research questions in parallel, \citeauthor{Gieryn1978} proposed four mechanisms of gradual change, including ``accretion'' (a problem is added to their ``problem set''),  ``selective substitution'' (one problem is replaced by another), and ``selective disengagement'' (one problem is neglected).

While these works document the structure of changes in scientists' interests, they do not relate these transformations to changes in epistemic and institutional context, to scientists' incentives, or to the resources that scientists can leverage in order to broaden their research opportunities. %Overall, they show that i) problem change is gradual, and that ii) it involves different scales, such that scientists can investigate different problems while remaining in the same broad research area and/or preserving certain ``core interests''.
Particularly, they do not explain differences in the behaviors of physicists, except in terms of their subfields of origin or their academic ages \citep{Aleta2019,Zeng2019}. \citet{Tripodi2020} have taken a significant step in this direction. Using the \gls{aps} dataset, they show that physicists are more likely to explore areas closer to their core specialization or areas to which they are connected via their collaborators. Their work highlights the crucial importance of collaborations in the expansion of research portfolios, especially for the exploration of cognitively distant research areas. %Moreover, they consider other variables such as scientists' amount of publications and coauthors, the popularity of the target subfield, differences in citations between the core and target subfield. %They find that amount of co-authors is generally associated with negative probability of having explored a given subfield; in contrast, popularity and relative citations are positively associated.
However, their work does not primarily address the \textit{transformations} of scientists research portfolios throughout time -- they do not quantify ``change'' and its magnitude --, and they recognize the need for further longitudinal analyses.

The present paper complements previous works in several ways. First, since the focus is on adaptation strategies, the core of our approach is both comparative (as in \citealt{Tripodi2020}, and unlike other previous works) \textit{and} longitudinal (unlike \citealt{Tripodi2020}, although their paper includes longitudinal robustness checks). Second, this contribution evaluates previously unexplored aspects, such as the choice between expansion or consolidation of research portfolios and the effect of institutional stability on change. %; the evaluation of the outcomes (in terms of citations) of different strategies. 
Third, this work relates the findings to the epistemic context of the field and its transformations by performing the analysis at a smaller scale (high-energy physics alone, rather than physics as a whole). Fourth, this work does \textit{not} rely on the \gls{aps} dataset and \gls{pacs} categories, on which most previous works depend \citep{Jia2017,Aleta2019,Battiston2019,Tripodi2020,Feifan2023}. A different dataset is employed, and research areas are clustered using a topic model, so that the contributed methodology can in principle be applied to any body of literature (consequently, some of our results are reproduced on a corpus of Computational Linguistics research \citep{acl_anthology_corpus}). Finally, the proposed approach is grounded in theory, by translating concepts such as capital \citep{Bourdieu1980,Bourdieu1986} into quantitative constructs, and by exploiting theoretical insights from diverse approaches to ``adaptation''.

\subsection{\label{sec:conceptual}Conceptual framework}

Scientists' opportunities are constrained by their prior knowledge, since entering new research areas involves learning costs. Yet, %the exploitation of prior knowledge may benefit from adjustments to new realities. 
through a gradual process of adaptation, scientists can strategically retain  the benefits of ``problem retention'' (e.g., the exploitation of ``accumulated skills and resources'' in one area, or ``of an established research network'', \citealt[p.~106]{Gieryn1978}) while progressively investing resources in new research directions. %Let us propose a brief account of how scientists can navigate changes in their scientific landscape through gradual strategies of adaptation.
This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:research-agenda}, %how scientists can reshape their research agenda portfolio gradually, e.g. for seizing new research opportunities, while taking advantage of their own prior knowledge base as much possible.
which represents the research agendas of one scientist during two distinct time periods. Cells indicate the resources exploited by the scientist (e.g., concepts, models, methods, or techniques) and colors indicate to what problem areas this knowledge applied. A resource can be applied simultaneously to different ends, as expressed by the hatched cell; however, resources are often directed towards specific research purposes. 
% Indeed, although scientists can embrace specialization and commit to similar problems with the same theoretical and methodological tools
Figure \ref{fig:research-agenda} shows how scientists can enter new research areas by repurposing certain resources to new ends \citep{Mulkay1974,schon1963displacement}. We call this strategy ``\textit{conversion}'', in reference to the typology of incremental institutional change proposed by \citet{mahoney_thelen_2009}; indeed, as shown in previous works on the transformations of high-energy physics facilities to photon science instruments \citep{Hallonsten2013,hallonsten2015formation,Heinze2017a}, historical institutionalism can account for gradual adaptations with large cumulative effects taking place in response to scientific and technological change \citep{Heinze2012}. In this paper, we apply the typology of change to \textit{individuals} rather than organizations. 

Not all knowledge can be successfully applied to new research areas, and scientists are more likely to shift resources and attention to domains that are less ``cognitively distant'' from their previous expertise. Additionally, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:research-agenda}, entering new research areas typically requires ``\textit{layering}'' (again, borrowing the terminology from historical institutionalism), that is, the introduction of new concepts, models, or methods, on top of prior knowledge. However, the acquisition of knowledge entails learning costs, although those can be partially avoided by collaborating with experts in the target domain \citep{Tripodi2020}. Another mode of change is \textit{displacement}, when the replacement of one research area for another involves significant neglect of prior knowledge. % or \textit{dismantling} (by abandoning a body of knowledge altogether).
This may not be the preferred strategy, since it fails to take advantage of accumulated knowledge. However, certain knowledge may not apply to a new context, or sometimes there might be reasons to suspend a line of research in order to focus on more promising topics.

Scientists manage two kinds of assets when navigating the trade-off between specialization and adaptation: their own prior expertise, and the expertise to which they have access through their social network. Both constitute ``capital'' \citep{Bourdieu1986}, i.e. assets that individuals accumulate and leverage in the competitive context of their field. ``Capital''  (whether ``economic'', ``cultural'', ``social'' or even ``symbolic'', cf. \citealt{Bourdieu1986}) defines the scope of scientists' opportunities and therefore their ability to adapt. This paper considers the \textit{cultural capital} possessed by scientists in the form of scientific knowledge (which will be referred to as ``intellectual capital''), and \textit{social capital}. %\footnote{Although we do not consider economic capital, it is in principle relevant for research that requires expensive material, the hiring of many technicians, or large computing resources.}.
Measures that represent these concepts will be proposed, and their effect on the magnitude of transfers of attention across research areas will be evaluated. Emphasis will be put on the divide underlined in \citealt{Abbasi2014} between two dimensions of social capital, namely ``power'' (in fact, network size in the present paper) and ``diversity'' (of cognitive resources). Group diversity is generally recognized as a factor of adaptation in an evolving environment \citep{Schimmelpfennig2021,Muthukrishna2016,page2008difference,Henrich2004}. ``Power'' is also plausibly associated with higher abilities.

While capital defines scientists' opportunities, it is not sufficient to explain \textit{why} scientists \textit{do} turn to new research areas or not, which also requires understanding actors' incentives and why they must respond to these incentives. Consequently, the present paper also considers the effect of institutional stability on migrations between research areas, since the need to respond to changes in the epistemic and institutional environment is presumably different for physicists applying to new jobs than it is for tenured professors and researchers.% Moreover, the outcomes (in terms of citations) of various trajectories will be compared.

Before introducing the methodology, the next section elaborates on the relevance of high-energy physics as a prime example for investigating adaptation in a transforming scientific landscape. 


\subsection{\label{sec:hep}The case of high-energy physics: navigating a changing epistemic landscape}

The field of particle physics has relied on the input of increasingly large particle colliders to achieve progress, and it has accumulated considerable capital directed towards collider physics in the form of large infrastructure and complex knowledge. These efforts culminated in 2010 with the start of the \gls{lhc}, the largest accelerator ever. However, the LHC has found no evidence for anything that was not already predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics, and it is increasingly plausible that no future accelerator could ever find any evidence for new particles, leading to a situation of ``crisis'' \citep{susy_crisis}. Although the \gls{lhc} will continue to take data for years and plans for future accelerators are being discussed \citep{Roser2023}, some have even speculated that particle physics as we know it has come to an end \citep{Harlander2023,Kosyakov2023}%\footnote{As \citet{Harlander2023} put it, ``we [\dots] have to face the possibility that the age of particle discoveries as we know them today is over''.}
, ``the proscenium
[being] captured by astrophysics and cosmology'' instead \citep{Kosyakov2023}. In a recent assessment of the field, physicist Mikhail Shifman claimed that the ``pause in accelerator programs we are witnessing now is not necessarily [\dots] the end of explorations at [high energies]''; instead, such explorations ``will continue, perhaps in a new form, with novel devices'' \citep{Shifman2020}. Indeed, new experimental opportunities have emerged in parallel. Gravitational Waves astronomy began in 2015, with the first ``direct'' detection of such waves from a black-hole merger by LIGO \citep{Abbott2016}. Other opportunities include direct searches of dark matter of astrophysical origin in underground facilities (e.g. LUX and Xenon experiments), and more precise data on the early universe from the Planck observatory. %These transformations in the landscape of experimental opportunities in high-energy physics can be visualized in Figure \ref{fig:experiments}. This Figure shows the share of citations received by the most cited experiments in high-energy physics. It shows the dominance of the Large Hadron Collider in accelerator-based research since its start in 2010. Indeed, investigating higher energies requires such large experiments that their can be no contender to the \gls{lhc}. Moreover, Figure \ref{fig:experiments} reveals the emergence of probes of astrophysical phenomena in \gls{hep}, e.g. the cosmic microwave background (which provides information about dark matter and early universe physics), gravitational waves and direct dark matter detection. Another phenomenon of interest the declining interest in neutrino experiments since the early 2000s, especially in experiments studying non-astrophysical neutrinos\footnote{The Super-Kamiokande experiment and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory found conclusive evidence for neutrino oscillations in 1998 and 2001 respectively. Takaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald were awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics for these discoveries (\url{https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2017/09/advanced-physicsprize2015.pdf}).}. 
In fact, astrophysics seems to be increasingly replacing particle colliders in citations across experimental and theoretical high-energy physics.  \citep{Gautheron2023}. These transformations have unfolded gradually: the LHC started in 2010 but it operated much below its target energy until 2015; Planck released data on the cosmic microwave background between 2010 and 2018; etc. (see Figure \ref{fig:experiments}, Appendix \ref{appendix:landscape}). The present paper investigates how high-energy physicists have adapted in reaction to these changes in their field. %In doing so, we aim to explore the contribution of different factors that may have affected the trajectories of individual physicists: why have certain physicists moved on to other topics, while others have pursued similar interests instead? 

\section{\label{sec:methods}Methods}

\subsection{\label{sec:data}Data}

Our source is the Inspire HEP database \citep{InspireAPI}. It aggregates \gls{hep} literature from various sources, including the main scientific publishers and arXiv, and has been used in a number of works \citep{Gautheron2023,Perovi2016,Chall2019a,Strumia2021,Sikimi2022}. For the literature on \gls{hep}, it is more comprehensive than the until now dominating \gls{aps} dataset which is limited to a few journals\footnote{\url{https://journals.aps.org/datasets}}. The database is free-access and includes semantic data for each paper (mainly their title and abstract, sometimes also keywords and \gls{pacs} categories), curated authorship and institutional affiliations, lists of references and associated experiments. This database implements both automatized and manual measures for the disambiguation of author names\footnote{Besides the use of ``advance algorithms'' of author-disambiguation, Inspire invites scientists to correct their own publication record on the website (\url{https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/Inspire/WebHome/INSPIRE_background.pdf}, June 2014)} %-- authors are given the opportunity to correct their records, and they have an incentive to do so.
, thus allowing careers' analyses \citep{Strumia2021}. Nevertheless, occasional misidentifications remain possible. %Full texts are not directly provided, although most of them could in theory be retrieved from arXiv.

The present analysis includes all papers from the categories ``Theory-HEP'' and ``Phenomenology-HEP'' (according to the classification of the database which is based on that of arXiv), to which most \gls{hep} publications belong. The minority of purely experimental high-energy physics publications are excluded: such papers are typically authored by thousands of collaborators, and authorship data provide no information about individual experimentalists' specialization. Therefore, this paper documents how theorists and phenomenologists have adapted to the changes outline above. In total, the corpus includes $D=186,162$ articles published between 2000 and 2019.

For the longitudinal analysis, two time periods are considered. An initial phase (2000-2009) is used to infer a reference ``research agenda'' for each physicist in the cohort, as well as their intellectual and social capital. A late phase (2015-2019) is used to measure how each physicist's research agenda has shifted in comparison to the initial time period, in the context of the changes outlined above. The five-year gap between these two periods allows to measure the cumulative effect of the transformations in the scientific landscape that have unfolded gradually between 2010 and 2015 (had they been sudden, we would not have introduced such a wide gap), as well as the effect of the capital accumulated \textit{prior} to these transformations. Only physicists with $\geq 5$ publications during each time period (2000 to 2009, and 2015 to 2019) are included, resulting in a cohort of $N=2\,195$ physicists. This study therefore considers physicists that have remained dedicated to high-energy physics, thus revealing the physicists' strategies for adapting and ``surviving'' within \gls{hep},  excluding authors that exited the field. Furthermore, our author inclusion rule excludes scientists who publish very irregularly; however, although scientists who continuously publish are a minority, they make up most of the publications in their field\footnote{Less than 1\% of scientists active in the years 1996 to 2011 have published every year during this period, and yet this minority is responsible for 47\% of the publications \citep{Ioannidis2014}, and the 13\% of physicists with $\geq 16$ publications over the course of 24 years account for 82\% of publications \citep{Feifan2023}.}. In any case, we do not seek ``representativeness'': we only aim to achieve enough variance to uncover patterns among this particular cohort of productive high-energy physicists. The median academic age of the physicists in the cohort was 23 years in 2015, and 49\% of them have had an affiliation that spanned the entire time period (see Appendix \ref{appendix:sample_characteristics}, Figure \ref{fig:sample_characteristics}). 

\subsection{\label{sec:topics}Measuring research agendas}

The measurement of research portfolios relies neither on \gls{pacs} categories (in contrast to \citealt{Jia2017,Battiston2019,Aleta2019,Tripodi2020}) nor on citation data (unlike \citealt{Zeng2019}). Instead, research areas are extracted with a topic model that recovers latent ``topics'' within the corpus and their vocabulary distributions \citep{Blei2003,Griffiths2004}. This makes the approach applicable to a wider range of situations for which only textual data (even short texts) are available. Arguably, texts also provide a more direct access to ``behavior'' or the structure of knowledge. A coarse-grained classification of the literature is performed into $K=20$ broad ``topics''. The number of topics is always somewhat arbitrary, but this is not as much an issue of topic models themselves: as \citet{Gieryn1978} puts it, ``in such analyses [of problem change], empirical findings will in part reflect the defined scope of problem areas'', which is itself arbitrary. In fact, that topic models give some control over the cognitive scale is a feature, rather than a bug\footnote{Previous works based on the \gls{pacs} categories have leveraged the different levels of this hierarchical classification system to investigate different scales.}.

We use the Embedding Topic Model developed by \citealt{Dieng2020}, which relies on pretrained embeddings representations of the keywords thus providing more reliable classifications of heavy-tailed vocabulary distributions. %\footnote{For rarely occurring keywords, meaning can be better inferred by taking advantage of their proximity with other keywords within documents, which is precisely the kind of information that word-embeddings encode. Traditional topic models dismiss all information about the relative position of keywords.},
% which is especially important in our case, since we seek accurate estimates of the amount of keywords in each abstract that belong to each ``topic''.
We train the model the abstracts of the $D=186,162$ documents published between 2000 and 2019. Keywords are extracted from the papers' titles and abstracts by filtering n-grams between one and three words matching syntactic expressions susceptible of carrying scientific information (by designating concepts, models, methods, etc.), following the procedure from \citealt{Gautheron2023,omodei_tel-01097702}. Embeddings are learned using a skip-grap model in $L=50$ dimensions (few are needed given the small size of the vocabulary, $V=4,751$). We obtain the topics listed in Appendix \ref{appendix:topics}, Table \ref{table:research_areas}. This table shows their most frequent keywords, as well as the \gls{pacs} categories that are most correlated with them. Four of the 20 resulting topics regroup keywords that do not clearly refer to any specific research area (e.g. ``paper'', ``approach'') and correlate poorly with the \gls{pacs} categories, which suggests their lack of scientific dimension. Consequently, the present analysis only considers the $K=16$ remaining topics that designate actual research areas (as confirmed by their strong tendency to cite themselves, cf. Appendix \ref{appendix:citation_validation}, and their correlation with the \gls{pacs} classification, cf. Appendix \ref{appendix:pacs_validation}).

%In the evaluation of the ``topic content'' of each document, we discard ambiguous keywords that do not clearly carry scientific content in order to obtain more informative distributions.

Then, we derive $n_{dk}$, the amount of keywords in the abstract of $d$ that refer to a research area $k$\footnote{See Appendix \ref{appendix:keywords} for further details on the counting procedure.}, and consequently $X_{a,k}$, the amount of times keywords (``resources'', i.e. concepts, models, methods, etc.) in relation to research area $k$ have occurred in papers (co-)authored by $a$ in the initial time-period (2000 to 2009). Mathematically, $X_{a,k}=\sum_{d\in P,a\in A_d} n_{d,k}$, where $A_d$ is the set of authors of a publication $d$, and $P$ is the set of papers published between 2000 and 2009. The matrix $Y_{a,k}$ is derived identically, using publications from the later time period (2015 to 2019). Research portfolios are represented by the normalized distributions $x_{ak} \equiv X_{ak}/\sum_{k'} X_{ak'}$ and $y_{ak} \equiv Y_{ak}/\sum_{k'} Y_{ak'}$. They encode how scientists divided their attention between research areas during each period.

\subsection{\label{sec:capital}Measuring capital}

Evaluting the effect of intellectual and social capital on scientists' trajectories requires quantitative measures of these concepts. An extensive review of prior usage of Bourdieu's notion of capital in bibliometrics has been provided by \citet[p.~198-200]{Schirone2023}, with most references addressing symbolic and social capital, and none addressing cultural capital. In the following, a consistent approach to intellectual and social capital is proposed, from which measures of diversity and power are derived.

\subsubsection{Intellectual capital}

Intellectual capital is represented by a vector $\bm{I_a}=(I_{ak})$ that measures the concentration of $a$'s intellectual resources in each domain $k \in \{1,\dots,K\}$. It is constructed in a way similar to $\bm{x_{a}}$, summing the contribution of keywords dedicated to each research area in the publications of each author between 2000 and 2009, except that publications are now weighed differently depending on their amount of authors. Indeed, publications with fewer co-authors convey more information about each author's own expertise. The weight is $1 \over |A_d|$, where $|A_d|$ is the amount of authors of publication $d$\footnote{A justification for this weight is that the probability that a given author has been responsible for introducing any particular concept or method present in the paper is $\mathcal{O}(1/|A_d|)$. }:

\begin{equation}
    I_{ak} \propto  \sum_{d\in P,a\in A_d} \dfrac{n_{d,k}}{|A_d|}
\end{equation}

$\bm{I_a}$ is normalized, such that $\sum_k I_{ak}=1$; therefore, $\bm{I_a}$ only captures the ways scientists divide their cognitive resources between research areas, rather than the ``absolute magnitude'' of their knowledge of each area.  

\subsubsection{Social capital}

Many measures of scientists' social capital have been proposed \citep{Abbasi2014,Schirone2023}, the simplest being the amount of collaborators of a scientist (i.e. degree centrality in the co-authorship network). Other measures are related to \textit{betweeness} centrality, which concerns the extent to which an actor ``bridges'' a network (e.g. ``brokerage'', i.e., the ability of an individual to overcome ``structural holes'' in a social network, \citealt{BurtBrokerage2007}). The difference between these measures matter; for instance, redundant contacts (and sheer network size) can be detrimental. \citet{Abbasi2014} distinguishes two general approaches to social capital, depending on whether the emphasis is placed on ``power'' versus ``diversity''. Measures of social capital (as those reviewed and proposed in \citealt{Abbasi2014}) typically represent social capital by single scalars; however, social capital has multiple dimensions. In fact, according to \citet{Bourdieu1980}, ``the volume of social capital possessed by a particular agent [\dots] depends on the extent of the network of links that he can effectively mobilize, and on the volume of capital (economic, cultural or symbolic) possessed by each of those to whom he is linked''. In that respect, social capital can come in different forms depending on the resources being leveraged via one's network. %and which are more relevant depends on the context.
In the following, we focus on the intellectual dimension of social capital, which we represent by a vector $\bf{S}_{a}$  %that encodes the amount of expertise in each research area   available to scientists via their network. %It is a function of i) how many collaborators a scientist has -- as inferred from the co-authorship network --, ii) the strength of these collaborations, and iii) how much expertise each of their collaborators holds in each research area.
%$\bf{S}_{a}$ is 
defined as the sum of the intellectual capital of $a$'s collaborators, weighted by the strength of their relationship:

\begin{equation}
    \bm{S}_{a} \equiv \sum_{c \in \text{co-authors}(a)} w_{ac} \bm{I}_{c\backslash a}
\end{equation}

$\bm{I}_{c\backslash a}$ is the intellectual capital of $c$, evaluated by excluding papers co-authored with $a$ (in order to disentangle the effect of an author's own intellectual capital and intellectual capital available to them in social form). Collaborators outside the cohort are taken into account. The weight $w_{ac}$, which represents the strength of the relationship between $a$ and $c$, is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    w_{ac} \equiv \max_{d|\{a,c\} \subset A_d} \frac{1}{|A_d|-1}
    \label{eq:weighing_scheme}
\end{equation}

Where $A_d$ is the set of the co-authors of a paper $d$. This weighing scheme -- inspired from \citealt{Newman2004} -- captures the fact that a paper with, say, two co-authors, signals a stronger relationship between the authors than a publication with a dozen authors.\footnote{Assuming that in a collaboration, each author interacts with a constant amount of co-authors in practice (regardless of the total amount of co-authors), then the probability that they had interactions with one specific co-author in particular is $\propto \frac{1}{|A_d|-1}$. 
%Alternatively, if authors interact with all their co-authors, but devote a constant amount of time to the collaboration, then the average time spent with each co-author is, again, $\propto \frac{1}{|A_d|-1}$.
} However, Equation \eqref{eq:weighing_scheme} does not take into account the recency and frequency of collaborations.

\subsubsection{Diversity and power}

Measures of ``diversity'' (and ``power'') can be readily derived from $\bm{I_a}$ (and $\bm{S_a}$). A common measure of diversity is the Shannon entropy $H$ \citep{Jost2006}\footnote{The Shannon entropy of the discrete uniform distribution on $\{1,\dots,n\}$ is $\log{n}$, such as that the exponential of the entropy is roughly the effective amount of outcomes for the distribution ($n$).}. Let 
 $D(\bm{I_a})=\exp{H(\bm{I_a})}$ be the diversity of intellectual capital (and $D(\bm{S_a})=\exp{H(\bm{S_a})}$ that of social capital). Roughly speaking, these are measures of how many research areas scientists have
divided their cognitive or social resources among. In the cohort, individuals typically have cognitive resources in several research areas ($\mu_{D(\bm{I_a})}=6.1,\sigma=2.2$), and social capital is even more diverse ($\mu_{D(\bm{S_a})}=8.5,\sigma=2.2$). In fact, intuitively,  scientific collaborations enable individuals to take advantage of their group's diversity. Furthermore, $D(\bm{I_a})$ and $D(\bm{S_a})$ are highly correlated ($R=0.75$); indeed, individuals with more diverse expertise are more able to engage with diverse collaborators. Since the diversity of social capital is only expected to enhance individuals' abilities when it exceeds that of their own intellectual resources, from now on, only \textit{excess} social capital diversity $D^{\ast}(\bm{S_a})$ (defined as the residuals of the linear regression of $D(\bm{S_a})$ against $D(\bm{I_a})$, by ordinary least squares) is considered\footnote{\citet{Tripodi2020} noted the difficulty of determining the direction of the causal relationship between social resources and research interests. This approach aims to overcome the very same challenge.}.

The ``power'' dimension of social capital is evaluated as the \textit{magnitude} of social capital:

\begin{equation}
    P(\bm{S_a})\equiv \sum_k S_{ak} = \sum_{c \in \text{co-authors}(a)} w_{ac}
\end{equation}

``Power'' is therefore the amount of collaborators weighed by the strength of each relationship. Our measures of diversity and power depart from \citealt{Abbasi2014}, in which diversity is conflated with network size and power with performance. By combining semantic and authorship data, our approach assesses diversity more directly. % -- here, the logarithm conveys that gains from going from, say, 50 collaborators to 51 collaborators are much lesser than the benefits of going from, say, three to four collaborators. 

For each of these (diversity and power), an alternative measure is considered for robustness assessment (based on Stirling's index for diversity and brokerage for power). All measures are compared in Appendix \ref{appendix:capital_validation}. 

\subsection{\label{sec:model}Modelling trajectories}

Physicists' trajectories are modeled with a hierarchical multinomial logistic model. The intuition underlying the model is illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:model_schema_a},\ref{fig:model_schema_b},\ref{fig:model_schema_c}, and a more formal representation of the model is given in Figure \ref{fig:model_structure}. The occurrences of keywords that belong to each research are $k$ in papers by $a$ in the late time period, $\bm{Y_{a}} \in \mathbb{R}^K$, are assumed to be a function of the initial research portfolio ($\bm{X_{a}}$), thus capturing the intuition that research agendas are transformed via strategic transfers of knowledge from one research area to another (Figure \ref{fig:research-agenda}). $\bm{Y_{a}}$ is also a function of a mixing matrix $\theta_a$ that measures the fraction of attention redistributed to different research areas. $\theta_a$ is drawn from a hierarchical process, thus capturing the ``average'' cohort behavior. It is also a function of covariates ($\bm{Z_a}$ in Figure \ref{fig:model_structure}), in this case intellectual and social capital, which are hypothesized to affect individual behaviors. %Of course, one could consider the effect of many other covariates; for instance, the effect of holding specific bits of knowledge (models, methods, etc.).
Formally speaking, $\bm{Y_{a}}$ is assumed to derive from a multinomial process involving linear combinations of $(x_{ak})$:

\begin{equation}
    \bm{Y_a} \sim \text{multinomial}(\sum_{k=1}^{K} x_{ak}\theta_{ak1} ,\dots,\sum_{k=1}^{K}x_{ak}\theta_{akK})
\end{equation}

Where $\theta_{akk'}$ is the fraction of attention to a topic $k$ that has been redirected to a topic $k'$. %All that is observed are the variables ($\bm{X_{a}}$) and ($\bm{Y_{a}}$) (and covariates such as intellectual and social capital); however, $\theta$ can be inferred by leveraging the correlations between the attention devoted to a given research area in the initial phase and in the later phase: so is the power of ecological inference\footnote{A paradigmatic use-case of ecological inference is the estimation of voting trajectories. In this case, $\bm{X_a}$ and $\bm{Y_a}$ would be the votes registered for different candidates at two different elections at each precinct, and $\theta_{akk'}$ would be the fraction of voters from precinct $a$ having voted $k$ at the first election and $k'$ at the later election.}. 
Moreover, we introduce intellectual capital $\bm{I_a}$ and social-intellectual capital $\bm{S_a}$ as covariates for transfers $\theta$ in the model, through a generalized linear model:

\begin{equation}
    \bm{\theta_{ak}} = \text{softmax}\left(\beta_{ak1} + \gamma_{k1} I_{a1} + \delta_{k1} S_{a1}, \dots,\beta_{akK} + \gamma_{kK} I_{aK} + \delta_{kK} S_{aK}\right)
    \label{eq:glm}
\end{equation}

$\delta_{kk'}$ is the effect of the expertise in $k$ (social capital) that is available through the scientists' collaborators on the magnitude of transfers from $k$ to $k'$. Similarly, $\gamma_{kk'}$ is the effect of having more expertise in $k'$ (intellectual capital) on shifts from $k$ to $k'$. High values of $\gamma_{kk}$ (the diagonal elements of $\gamma$) would imply that physicists are more conservative toward research areas in which they have comparatively more expertise. The coefficients $\beta_{akk'}$ encode the average behavior of the cohort plus individual deviations to the average behavior that are unexplained by the covariates\footnote{The priors for this hierarchical model are:

\begin{align}
    \beta_{akk'} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{k k'},\sigma_{k k'}) \text{ for } 1\leq k' \leq K-1 \text{ and } \beta_{ak K} = \mu_{kK}\label{eq:beta}\\
    \mu_{k k'} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\lambda \times  \nu_{kk'},1) \text{ (average behavior)}\\
    \delta_{kk'} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\delta_0+\lambda ' \times \nu_{kk'},1) \text { (effect of social capital)}\label{eq:social_capital_nu}\\
    \gamma_{kk'} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)  \text { (effect of intellectual capital)}\\
    \sigma &\sim \mathrm{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

Where $\nu_{kk'}$ is the fraction of physicists with expertise in $k$ (that is, with more intellectual capital than average in $k$) who also have expertise in $k'$. %(see Appendix \ref{appendix:optimal_transport}, Figure \ref{fig:nu}).
Priors must be thought thoroughly, as certain invariances can lead to identification issues -- for instance, shifting $\mu$ by a constant does not change the likelihood.
}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{The fit is performed with Stan's Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo sampler (HMC is better behaved than Gibbs for such problems).%The variant of the model in \ref{appendix:knowledge} is more complex and a single-point estimate is obtained via gradient-descent instead.
}. %Of course, the model could be modified to accommodate different covariates can be considered. To illustrate that, Appendix \ref{appendix:knowledge} introduces an alternative model in which the covariate is a vector representing scientists' individual knowledge, thus allowing to measure the effect of specific keywords on transfers between research areas.
%Models of ecological inference such as this can be weakly identified, as the data alone sometimes poorly constrain individual values of $\bm{\theta_{ak}}$.
The predictive power of the model is assessed in Appendix \ref{appendix:model-performance}. %This warrants some caution when using models such as this one for studying specific individuals (e.g. by inspecting values of $\bm{\theta_{ak}}$ for one individual); the main interest of the model lies in its ability to capture the average effect of certain covariates (e.g. social capital). This weakness converges with the criticism of ecological inference raised by the ``ecological fallacy'' argument \citep{freedman1999ecological} according to which they are limits to what can be inferred about individuals based on aggregate data. 
%Nevertheless, this approach enables estimates of the effect of certain variables on transitions between research areas, and the Bayesian formulation naturally accounts for the uncertainty associated with limited identifiability. 

Our model is strongly connected to Optimal Transport \citep{muzellec2017tsallis,li2019learning}. Optimal Transport seeks the most efficient way to  ``transport'' a source distribution (say, $\bm{x}=(x_k)$) to a target distribution (e.g., $\bm{y}=(y_{k'}$)) through ``transfers'' $(\theta_{kk'})$ across their components, given a cost function $\sum_{k,k'} x_{k} \theta_{kk'}C_{kk'}$ (where $C_{kk'}$ is a cost matrix) \citep{Peyr2019}. The difference is that our Bayesian approach estimates transfers $\theta_{kk'}$ by minimizing a likelihood rather than a cost function. The connection with Optimal Transport suggests an economic interpretation of the reallocation of research efforts, which will be leveraged in Section \ref{sec:optimal-transport} to show that patterns of change in research interests are shaped by learning costs. %This shows that scientific communities adapt in a way that somewhat minimizes learning costs.  %Moreover, Optimal Transport induces distances between distributions (the distance between a source distribution and a target distribution being the minimal cost of ``transporting'' the former to the latter). Consequently, it can be the basis for measures of change or disruption of research agendas.

 \section{\label{sec:results}Results}

 \subsection{\label{sec:macro}Transfers across research areas}

Figure \ref{fig:sankey} shows the aggregate transfers of attention at the level of the cohort unveiled by the model. %The width of each flow is proportional to $\sum_a X_{ak}\theta_{akk'}$ (summing over each author $a$).
The most obvious feature is the overall conservatism of physicists toward their research area due to specialization. \gls{hep} has accumulated large amounts of human and economic capital -- thus securing certain research areas for a long time -- and is associated with more conservative research interests compared to other areas of physics \citep{Aleta2019}. Certain research areas have significantly grown, most notably ``dark matter'' and ``AdS/CFT'', while others --  ``neutrinos and flavor physics'' and ``string theory and supergravity'' -- have significantly shrunk. How scientists adapt is still determined by their prior knowledge; in other words, scientists' research interests exhibit path dependence \citep{Galesic2023}. %, as was already suggested in Figure \ref{fig:experiments} which showed the decreasing impact of neutrino experiments. 
The increasing interest in dark matter is mainly fueled by a shift away from ``neutrinos and flavor physics'' and ``electroweak sector'', while the growth in AdS/CFT and black hole research has been at the expense of ``string theory and supergravity'' research\footnote{This converges with physicist Peter Woit's controversial assessment that ``string theorists'' are no longer doing string theory per se, though they keep identifying themselves as string theorists. As Peter Woit puts it, citing the 2022 ``Strings'' conference: ``one thing that stands out is that the string theory community has almost completely stopped doing string theory.''; and, ``[presentations' titles] make very clear what the string theory community has found to replace string theory: black holes'' (Woit, 2022, \url{https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=12981});}. Smaller research areas such as ``classical fields'', ``dynamics'' or ``thermodynamics'' seem less cohesive, i.e., they are subject to larger transfers. These bodies of knowledge are linguistically coherent (and therefore appear as topics of their own) but yet are not able to sustain careers over the long run by themselves.

 \begin{figure}[h]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/sankey_control_nu.pdf}
     \caption{\textbf{Aggregate transfers of attention across research areas, between 2000-2009 (to the left) and 2015-2019 (to the right)}. Widths of flows are proportional to $\sum_a X_{ak}\theta_{akk'}$. Insignificant transfers (that happen less than expected by chance alone assuming uniform mixing) are transparent. }
     \label{fig:sankey}
 \end{figure}

It is insightful to look at specific careers. For instance, the two physicists who made the most abrupt switch from neutrinos to dark matter are shown in Figure \ref{fig:turns_neutrinos_dm}. Physicist A's personal website reads: ``I am working on particle astrophysics and cosmology. In particular, \textit{I am interested in dark matter problem in the Universe, and how to probe it using annihilation products such as energetic gamma rays and neutrinos}. [\dots]  I \textit{started my research career by studying supernova neutrinos from various aspects} [our emphases].''\footnote{\url{https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/s.ando/eng/Research.html}}. This is therefore an instance of ``conversion'' of prior knowledge to new purposes, one of the forms of change drawn from historical institutionalism represented in Figure \ref{fig:research-agenda}. Similarly, Physicist B started his career in Neutrino Physics with a PhD on the ``Semiclassical Analysis of Solar Neutrino Data''.  His personal webpage reads: ``My main research interests lie at the intersection of the fields of astrophysics, particle physics, and nuclear physics [\dots]. In the past several years, there has been strong growth at this intersection, in part due to new results from the ongoing experiments.''\footnote{\url{https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/beacom.7/}}. Moreover, Physicist A claims that ``Although [he is] a theoretical astrophysicist, [he] always consider prospects of current or near future generation of experiments and telescopes.''. This supports that experiments create opportunities (and pressures to adapt) that physicists accommodate by building upon their prior knowledge.

\subsection{\label{sec:optimal-transport}The structuring effect of learning costs on scientists' behavior}

As research priorities change, research efforts must be efficiently reallocated among scientists, given their prior knowledge. Here, we leverage the similarity between our model of scientists' trajectories and \gls{ot} \citep{muzellec2017tsallis,li2019learning} to formulate the observed behavior in economic terms and demonstrate that the shifts of attention are structured by the minimization of ``learning costs''. 

Let $\bm{x}=\sum_a \bm{x_a}$ be the cohort's initial distribution of attention across research areas (summing over each author $a$), and $\bm{y}=\sum_a \bm{y_a}$ the late distribution. Let us further assume that $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{y}$ can be considered ``fixed'' by the institutions (scientific leadership, laboratories, funding agencies, etc.) that define scientific priorities throughout time. In order to achieve the distribution of research efforts $\bm{y}$ given the previous distribution $\bm{x}$, some scientists must redirect their attention away from certain research areas (for which $y_k<x_k$) and towards more pressing ones (for which $y_k>x_k$). What is the most efficient way to reallocate research efforts and achieve the transition from $\bm{x}$ to $\bm{y}$? Intuitively, research areas should be assigned to scientists in a way that requires as few of them as possible to acquire new knowledge -- in other words, in a way that minimizes learning costs, given the way knowledge is distributed among individuals. This, as we show, can be framed as an Optimal Transport problem. Let $T_{kk'}$ be the coupling matrix that encodes how much attention has been shifted from one research area $k$ to a research area $k'$. There are two constraints on $T_{kk'}$: $\sum_{k'} T_{kk'} = x_k$, and $\sum_{k} T_{kk'} = y_{k'}$. These constraints encode the need to adapt (since $\bm{y}\neq \bm{x}$). But $T$ must also minimize learning costs ($C$), which are linear in $T$: $C=\sum_{k,k'}T_{kk'}C_{kk'}$, where $C_{kk'}$ is a cost matrix. The problem of finding the couplings $T_{kk'}$ that minimize the ``transportation'' costs (given a cost matrix $C_{kk'}$ and the constraints on $T_{kk'}$) is an instance of Optimal Transport problem \citep{Peyr2019}. Examples of Optimal Transport problems include how to efficiently transport ore from mines to factories given the distances between them, or the assignment of workers to firms \citep{galichon2018optimal}. In our case, the couplings are known (they were recovered by the model from Section \ref{sec:model}), and we want to infer the underlying cost matrix that these couplings minimize. The transfers from a research area $k$ to $k'$ for each individual are simply $x_{ak}\theta_{akk'}$. Summing over individuals yields the coupling matrix $T_{kk'}=\sum_a x_{ak} \theta_{akk'}$, which measures how much attention was shifted away from $k$ and toward $k'$ at the cohort level.

The problem of recovering the cost matrix $C_{kk'}$ given the couplings is called the Inverse Optimal Transport problem. Below, this problem is solved using a method proposed in \citealt{pmlr-v162-chiu22b}. %This method requires a prior on $P(C_{kk'})$ on the cost matrix\footnote{\citealt{pmlr-v162-chiu22b} considers the regularized \gls{ot} problem, with a regularization term $-\lambda H(T)$ in the objective function. $\lambda$ is unknown, and setting a prior on $C$ allows to avoid setting one on $\lambda$. Moreover, the prior lifts the degeneracy among the infinitely many cost matrices that yield the same optimum}, and
This method requires to put a prior on $P(C_{kk'})$ -- indeed, infinitely many cost matrices yield the same optimum, and priors are needed to lift this degeneracy. Following \citealt{pmlr-v162-chiu22b}, we consider a prior such that $\sum_{k,k'}C_{kk'}=\mathrm{cst}$. We assume that $\mathbb{E}(C_{kk'})\propto \mathrm{softmax}(\beta \times (1-\nu_{kk'}))$, where $\nu_{kk'}$ is the fraction of physicists who already held expertise in $k'$ among those who already held expertise in $k$, and $\beta\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is the effect of learning costs on $C_{kk
}$. If $\nu_{kk'}\sim 1$ (i.e. $1-\nu_{kk'}\sim 0$), then shifting attention from $k$ to $k'$ does not entail the acquisition of additional knowledge, and $C_{kk'}$ should be almost zero. If $\nu_{kk'}=0$ (i.e. $1-\nu_{kk'}= 1$), any scientist shifting from $k$ toward $k'$ must acquire new knowledge, and the cost should be maximal. If actual behaviors \textit{do} involve the minimization of learning costs, we should observe a strong correlation between $C_{kk'}$ and the ``knowledge gap'', which is $1-\nu_{kk'}$.

Using the ``MetroMC'' algorithm proposed in \citealt{pmlr-v162-chiu22b}, we empirically recover $C_{kk'}$, the underlying cost matrix (Appendix \ref{appendix:optimal_transport}, Figure \ref{fig:cost_matrix}). We find a strong correlation with the ``knowledge gap'': $R(C_{kk'},1-\nu_{kk'})=0.72$, such that $R^2=0.52$ (see Appendix \ref{appendix:optimal_transport}, Figure \ref{fig:cost_knowledge}). The empirical cost of shifting research efforts from one research area to another is therefore shaped by learning costs. The derivation of $C_{kk'}$ is potentially useful: one could in principle predict aggregate transfers of attention given a counterfactual target distribution of research efforts $\bm{y}$ using optimal transport and plugging-in $C_{kk'}$ as the cost matrix.

Under changing circumstances, research efforts must be reallocated efficiently. Therefore, scientific norms and institutions address an Optimal Transport problem by providing incentives for scientists to conform to new research imperatives, in a way that factors ``learning costs''. While this observation characterizes the cohort behavior, drivers of differences among individuals are considered next.

\subsection{\label{sec:magnitude}Individual behavior and the effect of capital}

\subsubsection{Magnitude of change and capital}

We propose a change score $c_a$ that measures how much the research agenda of a scientist has changed between the two time periods under consideration, defined for each physicist as the total variation distance between their initial and late research agendas:

\begin{equation}
    c_a \equiv \mathrm{d}_{\text{TV}}(\bm{x_a},\bm{y_a}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_k |y_{ak}-x_{ak}|
\end{equation}

$c_a$ is comprised between 0 (if research attention has remained identically distributed) and 1 (if the research agenda has been entirely redistributed). Large values of $c_a$ are rare, with 50\% of authors lying between 0.21 and 0.40  (Appendix \ref{appendix:change-model}, Figure \ref{fig:change_scores}). However, the absolute value of $c_a$ has limited interpretability, given that it depends on the choice of ``cognitive scope'' (the broadness of research areas) and the duration of the time periods considered  \citep{Gieryn1978}. Moreover, $c_a$ is never expected to be exactly zero due to random fluctuations and measurement noise.

Nevertheless, the change score allows for comparisons between physicists. We evaluate the effect of several factors on change: i) the diversity of intellectual capital $D(\bm{I_a})$; ii) the excess diversity of social capital $D^{\ast}(\bm{S_a})$; and iii) the magnitude of social capital (``power''). We also consider the effect of affiliation stability, represented by a binary variable $s_a$ ($s_a=1$ if scientist $a$ has at least one affiliation that spans the whole time range considered, and $s_a=0$ otherwise). We perform a linear regression of $c_a$ as a function of these four variables, adjusting for $Z_a=\argmax_{k} x_{ak}$, i.e. physicists' primary research area over the years 2000 to 2009 (see the model specification in Appendix \ref{appendix:change-model}).

The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:change_score_effect}. The diversity of intellectual capital has a significant positive effect: physicists with resources in many areas tend to revise their research agenda more. There is also evidence of a positive effect of diversity of social capital on the magnitude of changes in scientists' research focus. However, the \textit{magnitude} of social capital, ``power'', has a negative direct effect on change. In other words, ``power'' promotes stability, while ``diversity'' promotes change. It is noteworthy that these dimensions of social capital have opposite effects. Physicists with permanent affiliations are more conservative toward their research agenda, possibly because they experience less incentive to ``adapt''. Conversely, new positions might be associated with breaks in research topics.

Unsurprisingly, both research areas that have shrunk considerably have a significant positive effect on migration scores. ``Collider physics'', on the other hand, has a negative effect on the magnitude of change \textit{ceteris paribus}. All effects combined, physicists whose primary category is ``Collider physics'' are by far the most conservative, with an average change score 24\% lower than the rest of the cohort. Indeed, the long time-scales of collider experiments provide stable opportunities to physicists in that area \citep[p.~138]{galison1987how}, thus promoting conservatism. The variance explained remains low ($R^2=0.15$), and all these factors only partially explain differences between individuals.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{plots/change_score_effects_entropy_magnitude.eps}
    \caption{\textbf{Effect of measures of intellectual and social capital, and of position stability on $c_a$, the amplitude of changes in high-energy physicists' interests}. Diversity is evaluated in terms of the exponential of the Shannon entropy of the distribution of intellectual and social resources physicists possess across research areas. The effect of the primary research area during the initial period (2000-2009) was also included as a control. Three research areas have a significant (95\% CL) effect. Error bars indicate 95\% credible intervals; $\mu(\beta)$ denotes the mean posterior effect size. $R^2=0.15$. Continuous variables (diversity, power and the change score) are standardized.}
    \label{fig:change_score_effect}
\end{figure}

The change score $c_a$ neglects the cognitive gap between research areas. Figure \ref{fig:disruption_score_effect} in Appendix \ref{appendix:robustness} shows that, using an alternative measure of change (``disruption'') that takes into account cognitive distance, the diversity of social capital has a much larger effect ($\mu(\beta)=0.28$ instead of $0.091$). Moreover, using the Stirling index (rather than entropy) as a measure of diversity does not qualitatively change the previous results (see Table \ref{table:summary_change_disruption}, Appendix \ref{appendix:robustness}). Using the Stirling index as a measure of diversity, the diversity of social capital has an even stronger effect on disruption ($\mu(\beta)=0.85$). 

% A manual inspection of the 20 least and most conservative physicists of the cohort is conducted in Appendix \ref{appendix:cases} and is found to be consistent with these findings.

\subsubsection{Diversification of research interests versus consolidation of expertise}

Research portfolios can be altered by two opposite strategies. One strategy is ``diversification'', through the addition of new research areas. Another strategy is ``concentration'', by deserting certain research areas and concentrating increasingly on a core specialization (Figure \ref{fig:research-agenda} illustrates how this can happen, whether via ``conversion'' or ``displacement''). Figure \ref{fig:diversification_score_effect} shows the effect of the same factors as above on the probability that physicists have i) entered at least one new research area in between the two periods or ii) exited one research area (see the specification of the model in Appendix \ref{appendix:enter-exit-model})\footnote{A research area $k$ is considered ``entered'' by $a$ when $x_{ak}<\frac{1}{N}\sum_{a'}x_{a'k}$ and $y_{ak}>\frac{1}{N}\sum_{a'}y_{a'k}$; conversely, a research area is considered exited when $x_{ak}>\frac{1}{N}\sum_{a'}x_{a'k}$ and $y_{ak}<\frac{1}{N}\sum_{a'}y_{a'k}$.}.

The diversity of intellectual capital has a strong positive effect on the probability of exiting a research area; intuitively, scientists with diverse interests can afford to disengage from certain research areas. Excess diversity of social capital increases the probability of entering new research areas, but has no discernible effect on the probability of exiting research areas. In contrast, ``power'' significantly decreases the probability of leaving a research area. This suggests that having many collaborators allows scientists to remain committed to many research areas with minimal personal investment, thus stabilizing their research agendas (as previously observed). Moreover, ``power'' also decreases the probability to of entering new research areas; this suggests that powerful scientists have less incentives to invest resources in new topics. String theory \& supergravity has a significant positive effect of both entering and exiting research areas (suggesting it has been ``replaced'' by another topic by many physicists). ``Collider physics'', however, significantly decreases the probability of entering new areas. Indeed, the \gls{lhc} has secured this research area for decades, %Indeed, the epistemic returns of the \gls{lhc} increase with the amount data collected, and therefore with its operating time. Moreover, the large investments that were necessary for the \gls{lhc} tend to justify that it should be exploited as long as possible in order to make the best out of it.
and the High-Luminosity \gls{lhc}, an upgraded of the LHC set to achieve higher collision rates, is only scheduled to start in 2029\footnote{See \url{https://home.cern/science/accelerators/high-luminosity-lhc}. Note that until a successor to the \gls{lhc} is under active development, its prolongation can help preserve the know-how necessary for the design and operation of such complex experiments.}. ``Dark matter'' has a negative effect on the probability of entering a new research area, possibly because scientists with prior commitment to this research area had less incentive to diversify their research portfolio and more incentive to focus increasingly on this topic given its success over the following years. Again, these conclusions hold as an alternative measure of diversity is considered (\ref{appendix:robustness}, Table \ref{table:summary_entered_exited}) and if ``brokerage'' is used as a measure of power.

    \label{fig:diversification_score_effect}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Why diversity promotes change}

Access to diverse cognitive resources promotes change. To see why, it is insightful to look into how the concentration of scientists' intellectual capital in each research area $k$ ($\bm{I_a}=(I_{ak})$) affects their trajectories. In the model introduced in Section \ref{sec:model}, the diagonal coefficients of the $\gamma$ matrix measure the effect of having intellectual resources in a certain area on the commitment to this area. The matrix is shown in Figure \ref{fig:intellectual-capital-effect}. Most coefficients on the diagonal are significantly positive, thus suggesting that physicists with a strong specialization in a research area tend to further exploit and consolidate their specialization in this area.

The effect of social capital on transfers from one research area to another, given by the matrix $\delta_{kk'}$ (see equation \ref{eq:glm}), is shown in Figure \ref{fig:social-capital-effect}. Statistically significant effects are always positive: having moreand more collaborators with expertise in a target area generally increases the likelihood of redirecting attention toward this area, in line with a very recent observation that ``the probability for a scholar to start working on a new topic increases with the number of previous collaborators'' \citealt{Venturini2024}.

\caption{\textbf{Effect of capital on the magnitude of transfers of attention from one research area to another}. Rows represent research areas of origin and columns represent target research areas. Stars represent statistical significance according to the effect posterior distribution ($\ast$: 95\%; $\ast\ast$: 99.7\%). Effect sizes are increases in transfer log odds ($\log {[\theta_{akk'}/(1-\theta_{akk'})]}$, where $\theta_{akk'}$ is the fraction of attention to $k$ redirected to $k'$) per unit of intellectual or social capital in the target research area $k'$.}
\label{fig:test}
\end{figure}

The effect of social capital varies across research areas. Indeed, \citet{Tripodi2020} found that ``social-relatedness'' (i.e. whether scientists have immediate access to a subfield via a collaborator) is more crucial as scientists move further away from their specialization, and our model reproduces this finding. The effect of social capital ($\delta_{kk'}$) depends on the matrix $\nu_{kk'}\in[0,1]$, defined as the fraction of physicists with more expertise than average in a research area $k'$ among those who have more expertise than average in $k$ (see Eq. \eqref{eq:social_capital_nu}, Section \ref{sec:model}). We find a strong association, with $\delta_{kk'}$ decreasing by 1.5 unit of standard deviation on average as $\nu_{kk'}$ goes from 0 (nobody holds expertise in both research areas $k$ and $k'$) to 1 (everyone with expertise in $k$ has expertise in $k'$). In other words, the strength of the effect of social capital on shifts between two areas is higher when it is uncommon to hold expertise in both these areas.

% [To be continued\dots]
% \subsection{\label{sec:outcomes}Outcomes of changes in research interests}

% So far we have assumed that the cohort received incentives to adapt. One way to verify the incentives that physicists effectively received is to compare the pay-offs (in terms of, say, scientific credit) associated with different trajectories (from certain research areas to others). In this section, the outcomes (in terms of citations) of various trajectories are compared. To this end, partial h-indices $h_a^{I}$ and $h_a^{F}$ are calculated for each scientist $a$ of the cohort, based on the citations they received for the papers that they published during the initial (2000--2009) and final (2015-2019) time periods only. The effect of $x_{ak}\theta_{akk'}$ (how much attention was transferred from research $k$ to $k'$) on the h-index outcome is assumed to be of the form $\eta_{kk'} = \phi_{k'} + \psi_{kk'}$ such that $\phi_{k'}$ is the bonus associated with the exploration of research area $k'$ in the second time-period, and $\psi_{kk'}$ is the bonus associated with having shifted research attention from $k$ to $k'$. The estimate of $\eta_{kk'}$ allows us to compare contra-factual scenarios. For instance, the quantity $\eta_{kk'}-\eta_{kk}$ measures how much the h-index is enhanced by switching from one research area to another instead of pursuing the same research area. The full specification of the assumed causal model is given in Appendix \ref{appendix:outcomes}. The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:outcomes_rho}. Only five trajectories have a significant effect. It appears that scientists who left string theory \& supergravity for ``black holes'', ``dark matter'' or ``cosmology'' fared better than those who remained committed to string theory \& supergravity. Similarly, scientists who left neutrinos to pursue ``dark matter'' or ``cosmology'' ``performed'' better. Although it is unsurprising that leaving decaying research areas for increasingly popular ones enhances citations outcomes -- publications on problems that are widely investigated have more chances of being cited --, it is not trivial that scientists changing their research focus are successful in having impact.

\section{Discussion}

This paper addressed the conflict between specialization and conservatism in science, which are driven by the need to fully exploit accumulated knowledge, and the urge to adapt to changes in the epistemic landscape. To this end, an unsupervised Bayesian approach was developed, based on the intuition that scientists' shifts in research interests involve cumulative transfers of knowledge. The model simultaneously measures transfers of attention across research areas and the effect of various variables on the evolution of scientists' research portfolios, in particular intellectual and social capital.


% A connection was drawn between this phenomenon and that of institutional change under changing circumstances, by leveraging the typology of incremental change from historical institutionalism (``layering'', ``conversion'', ``displacement'', etc.) which suggests strategies through which scientists can progressively revise their research to navigate these two conflicting imperatives.



% A Bayesian model of changes in scientists' research portofolio was proposed on this basis.

The model was applied to a cohort of $N=2\,195$ high-energy physicists between the years 2000 and 2019. At the macroscopic level, it reveals the decline of neutrinos physics due to migrations towards the electroweak sector (explored at the \gls{lhc}) and more importantly towards dark matter. Similarly, many physicists have redirected their efforts from the electroweak sector towards dark matter. Moreover, string theory \& supergravity has started to disintegrate into black holes and AdS/CFT research. This demonstrates that the cohort has responded to changes in experimental opportunities as well as to theoretical developments in quantum gravity. 

Then, leveraging the connection between our model and \glsreset{ot}\gls{ot}, we showed that the reallocation of research efforts among scientists is shaped by learning costs. Indeed, under changing circumstances, scientific institutions must address an \gls{ot} problem by efficiently reallocating research efforts in a way that balances learning costs and the imperative to adapt to new circumstances. This has the effect of enhancing the utility of the scientific capital disseminated amongst scientists as the perceived payoff of certain research areas change. \gls{ot} therefore explains path dependency, as individuals seize the nearest opportunity available to them. \gls{ot} is also methodologically useful: Inverse \gls{ot} allows one to derive cost functions from observed behavior, and thus offers a potential way to better connect empirical data with rational-choice models of scientists' behavior that postulate hidden utility functions. Moreover, it has the potential of informing policy by identifying potential bottlenecks if research efforts were to be reallocated in certain ways (as one can use \gls{ot} to estimate the ``cost'' of various counterfactual scenarios). Overall, this approach illustrates that the adaptability of epistemic communities is constrained by the details of how knowledge is distributed among individuals. It underlines how path dependency arise, as individuals follow a path of least effort given the adaptive pressures from their environment. %However, this in itself does not indicate whether scientific institutions and norms shape scientists' strategic behavior by influencing their individual cost-benefit calculus or through coercion.

The longitudinal comparative analysis of physicists' trajectories revealed that the diversity of intellectual and social capital is positively associated with change: diversity promotes adaptability under new circumstances, and therefore diversifying research portfolios is a reasonable strategy when the future is uncertain. However, enforcing diversity can lead to suboptimal allocations of research efforts under stable circumstances \citep{Schimmelpfennig2021}. Differences among research areas are found: physicists expert in particle colliders have remained particularly conservative, possibly because they have secured long-term research opportunities (thanks to very large investments in particle accelerators like the \gls{lhc}). There is also evidence that physicists specialized in dark matter have been consolidating their specialization, presumably because the increasing popularity of the topic encouraged them to double down their investment in this research area. Higher concentrations of intellectual capital in certain research areas generate stronger commitment to these research areas; therefore, specialized scientists are more at risk of being trapped in a sunk cost fallacy as their expertise becomes unsuitable for new circumstances. However, specialized scientists can offset the risks associated with specialization by diversifying their social network. This raises the possibility of free-riding, as scientists are encouraged to focus on what seems most promising at the time and let their peers take the risk of exploring alternatives until their value is established \citep{Kummerfeld2016}. Additionally, social capital plays an increasingly important role as scientists expand their research agenda further beyond their specialization, as observed by \citealt{Tripodi2020}, suggesting that collaborations are crucial in overcoming cognitive barriers between research areas. Unlike diversity, ``power'' (that is, the magnitude of social capital) and institutional stability are associated with more stability and conservatism in research interests. We suggest that coalitions and institutional resources can safeguard individuals from pressures to adapt. The negative association between change and institutional stability, albeit weak ($\mu(\beta)=-0.14$), suggests that scientific institutions may be exploiting temporary contracts to compel the scientific workforce to adapt.

% Our work has various policy implications. First, it emphasizes the importance of the diversity of scientists' social network for their adaptability. Therefore, this aspect should be considered during hiring processes. Second, we offer a methodology that can be used to track scientists' response to change. This approach can also be applied to institutions themselves and their publication record. In principle, the proposed methodolody enables institutions to measure their success in redirecting resources to new research directions.

We have characterized renewal strategies of research portfolios in terms of a typology of incremental change developed in the context of historical institutionalism, which has been shown to account for how organizations like DESY and SLAC have transitioned from \gls{hep} to multi-purpose photon science. Adaptation strategies include the ``conversion'' of prior knowledge to new purposes, the ``layering'' of additional research interests via the acquisition of new knowledge, or the ``displacement'' of former research commitments. Indeed, institutions can face a challenge similar to that experienced by specialized scientists who are confronted with transformations in their scientific landscape, in that they too must adapt and redirect accumulated capital in directions that may not have been foreseen at the time of their ``design''. The \gls{lhc} itself has evolved through similar processes of gradual repurposing of prior infrastructure, including the tunnels \citep{Smith2015}. Adaptation prompts individuals (and collectives) to efficiently repurpose capital previously accumulated in different forms (cultural, social, economic, etc.), which in turn creates path-dependence. Following \citealt{Galesic2023}, we conclude that a better understanding of collective adaptation benefits from the pooling of diverse insights: while studies of institutional change have documented strategies of gradual adaptation that progressively leverage and repurpose accumulated capital when change is difficult, the literature on cultural evolvability stresses the critical roles of ``diversity'' and social learning. In return, this work provides an empirical contribution to the literature that treats science as a cultural evolutionary system \citep{Wu2023}.

% Finally, the outcomes of transfers from one research area to another were also studied, by measuring the effect of the research agenda distribution and transfers between research areas on authors' success (in terms of citations). Scientists who exited neutrino physics and string theory for dark matter and cosmology (and also black holes in the case of string theory) had more impact than those who remained committed to neutrinos and strings. This suggests that there has indeed been an incentive to turn to these research areas and/or that scientists with expertise in these area (Strings and Neutrinos) were ``successful'' in taking this turn.

% \subsection{Discussion}

%     \item Diversity vs power
%     \item Specialization vs conservatism/stability. Risk management.

Throughout the paper, various methodological limitations were raised. Most of them pertain to data selection. For example, the requirement on the quantity of authors' publications makes the cohort atypical. A second issue, already noted by \citet{Gieryn1978}, lies in the arbitrariness in the choice of cognitive scope. Previous works (e.g. \citealt{Jia2017,Aleta2019,Tripodi2020}) have typically relied on the hierarchical \gls{pacs} classification of physics literature, such that cognitive scales were imposed. For this work, the literature was divided into 16 topics that captured the features of change in the epistemic landscape discussed above, i.e. the rise of new probes of the cosmos, but other scales could have been considered. However, the topic model recovers a flat structure that does not explain the correlations between different research areas, and a hierarchical structure of knowledge might be more suitable for capturing what allows physicists to switch from one research area to another. Moreover, although the unsupervised topic model approach is arguably a better proxy to linguistic and cognitive behavior, it introduces noise which could in part explain the low predictive power of the models of change in scientists' research agendas.

\subsection{\label{appendix:topics}Topics}

\subsubsection{\label{appendix:keywords}Keyword classification}

In the Embedding Topic Model used in the present paper -- as in topic models in general--, documents are mixtures of several topics; moreover, keywords may belong to several topics. This is a desirable feature: certain concepts serve different purposes depending on the context, and some concepts do not clearly belong to any research area. More importantly, this is crucial to the present approach, given that we must be sensitive to situations in which scientists have repurposed certain concepts to new research goals; i.e., instances where the same resources are applied in a new context (a new research area).
For that, each keyword $i$ from a document $d$ is assigned a research area $z_{di} := \argmax_{k=1,\dots,K} P(z_{di}=k|w_{di},\bm{\theta}_{d})$, which is the research area most probably associated with the keyword $i$ given the topic distribution of the document $\bm{\theta}_d$ -- i.e. the context. In fact:

\begin{equation}
    z_{di} := \argmax_{k=1,\dots,K} P(z_{di}=k|w_{di},\bm{\theta}_{d}) =  \argmax_{k=1,\dots,K} \dfrac{P(w_{di}|z_{di}=k)P(z_{di}=k|\bm{\theta}_d)}{P(w_{di}|\bm{\theta}_d)}
\end{equation}

In the process, we discard ambiguous keywords for which $H(z_{di})\geq \log{2}$, where $H$ denotes the entropy of the distribution $P(z_{di}=k|w_{di})$. Either such keywords do not carry any scientific content, or the context is insufficient to disambiguate among the possible research areas to which they might belong.

The average effective amount of topics in documents according to the topic model -- measured as $\exp H(\bm{\theta}_{d})$ where $H$ is the Shannon entropy -- is 7.5, which is unrealistically high. The filtering and classification procedure reduces the average effective amount of topics to 3.2 per document, which is much more informative. This procedure is especially important for short texts such as abstracts, which poorly constrain the latent topic distribution $\bm{\theta}_{d}$.

\subsubsection{List of topics}

\subsubsection{\label{appendix:citation_validation}Topic validation using the citation network}

In order to validate the consistency and scientific dimension of the topics that were recovered, we verify that papers from a given topic tend to cite more papers from the same topic. Let $N_{k,k'}$ be the amount of citations of articles that belong to topic $k'$ originating from articles that belong to $k$, and $N=\sum_{k,k'}N_{k,k'}$ the total number of citations. From this matrix, a normalized pointwise mutual correlation $\mathrm{npmi}(k,k')$ is calculated:

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{npmi}(k,k') = \log {\dfrac{N_{k,k'}/N}{(\sum_{i} N_{k,i}/N)(\sum_{i} N_{i,k'}/N)}}
\end{equation}

$\mathrm{npmi}(k,k')$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:topic_citation_matrix}. It measures how frequent citations from $k$ to $k'$ are, relative to what would be expected if citations were uniformly distributed. The diagonal values are positive, indicating that the topics we retrieved tend to refer to themselves significantly more than expected by chance alone, providing further evidence of their scientific content and coherence.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{plots/topic_citation_matrix.eps}
    \caption{\textbf{Normalized pointwise mutual information $\mathrm{npmi}(k,k')$ of the citation matrix $N_{k,k'}$}. Positive values (in blue) indicate that the y-axis research area cites the x-axis research area more often than expected by chance; negative values indicate that citations occur less than expected by chance. When shown, individual values indicate how many times citations occur compared to chance alone. For instance, papers about Hadrons cite papers about Perturbative methods 1.4 times what would be expected if citations were uniform across research areas.}

\subsection{\label{appendix:capital_validation}Measures of capital}



Figure \ref{fig:capital_measures} shows the Pearson correlation between these diversity and power measures, as evaluated in the cohort of high-energy physicists. For comparison purposes, an alternative measure of diversity based on Stirling's index \citep{Stirling2007}, with prior applications to studies of interdisciplinarity \citep{Porter2007,Leahey2016} is evaluated\footnote{The Stirling-based diversity measured is evaluated as: \begin{equation}
    D_{\text{Stirling}} = 1-\sum_{k,k'}d_{kk'}I_{ak}I_{ak'}
\end{equation}

Where $d_{kk'}$ is the fraction of scientists who have more expertise than average in both $k$ and $k'$ among those that have expertise in one or the other (i.e., a similarity matrix); following previous approaches for measuring research interdisciplinarity \citealt{Porter2007,Leahey2016}.}. A measure of brokerage is also considered\footnote{We evaluated brokerage as the amount of pairs of scientists that have collaborated with a given physicist while having no common collaborator except for this physicist. This effectively measures the extent to which this physicist connects otherwise disconnected scientists.}. 

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:capital_measures}, the entropic measure of diversity considered in this paper correlates strongly with the Stirling measure. The magnitude of social capital (which is similar to degree centrality) correlates weakly with excess social diversity, thus emphasizing that power and diversity are partially orthogonal aspects of social capital. Power is strongly correlated with brokerage; indeed, strongly connected scientists, with higher degree centrality, are also those scientists who initiate collaborations between otherwise disconnected scientists, as measured by brokerage. Most importantly, brokerage correlates slightly better with measures of intellectual diversity than with excess social diversity. This suggests that the benefits of ``bridging'' positions in social networks can sometimes be confused with the benefits of the actors' own diversity of intellectual resources, which enables them to occupy such positions in the first place. This emphasizes the value of distinguishing the effect of individual intellectual capital from that of social capital.

% Nevertheless, brokerage is better correlated to diversity than sheer magnitude, thus demonstrating that different measures of social capital mix up both ``power'' and ``diversity''. Presumably, which dimension of capital (e.g., ``diversity'' or ``power'', per \citealt{Abbasi2014}) matters more depends on the criterion of performance under investigation, and must be assessed empirically.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{plots/capital_measures.eps}
    \caption{\textbf{Correlation between different measures of capital}. Measures considered in this analysis are shown in bold. Alternative measures are shown for comparison purposes. By construction, excess social diversity is orthogonal to intellectual diversity. }
    \label{fig:capital_measures}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\label{appendix:model-performance}Model performance}

The predictive power of the model can be assessed by evaluating the total variation distance between the true distribution $\bm{y_a}$ and the predicted distribution $\bm{y_a^{\text{pred}}}$. This performance metric is calculated via 10-fold cross-validation. It is compared  to a baseline model that predicts no change in the research agenda ($\bm{y_a^{\text{baseline}}}=\bm{x_a}$). The results are shown in Table \ref{table:performance}. For the cohort of high-energy physicists, the model performs only marginally better than the baseline, given that individuals have remained quite conservative on average, most of the fluctuations being difficult to predict. Table \ref{table:performance} also considers a cohort of scientists from the ACL anthology corpus  of computational linguistics research \citep{acl_anthology_corpus}, by running the same pipeline (the measurement of research portfolios during two consecutive time periods using our topic model approach and the training of the trajectory model). Although the data are of lesser quality (see Appendix \ref{appendix:hep_vs_acl}, Table \ref{table:corpora}), research portfolios have undergone much more significant transformations in this dataset (see Appendix \ref{appendix:hep_vs_acl}, Figure \ref{fig:sankey_acl}). Consequently, our model performs much better than the baseline for this cohort.

\subsection{\label{appendix:optimal_transport}Learning costs and optimal transport}

The MCMC algorithm from \citealt{pmlr-v162-chiu22b} is run on 500,000 iterations of the ``MetroMC'' algorithm, using a ``P1'' prior (that is, a prior such that $\sum_{kk'}C_{kk'}=C_0=\mathrm{cst}$). More precisely, we assume that:

\begin{align}
    P(c_{kk'}|p_{kk'}) &= \dfrac{1}{Z}\dfrac{1}{\displaystyle\prod_{kk'} c_{kk'}^{1/2}} \exp{\left(-\alpha D_{KL}(c_{kk'}||p_{kk'})\right)} \text{ with } c_{kk'} = C_{kk'}/C_0\\
    \text{ and } p_{kk'} &= \mathrm{softmax}(\beta (1-\nu_{kk'}))\\
\end{align}

The second equation is sometimes referred to as the entropic prior \citep{skilling1991bayesian,MacKay1995}. The mean posterior values of $C_{k,k'}$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cost_knowledge}, as a function of the knowledge gap from $k$ to $k'$. The knowledge gap  $1-\nu_{kk'}$ is the fraction of experts in $k$ who do not hold significant expertise in $k'$ ($\nu$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:nu}).  A significant correlation is found ($R=-0.72$). This is true also for the replication dataset of computational linguistics research (Appendix \ref{appendix:hep_vs_acl}), for which $R=-0.63$.

    k_a &= \argmax_k x_{ak}\\
    \beta,\mu &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\
    |\mu^{\text{area}}_k| &\sim \mathrm{Exponential}(\tau)\\
    \tau,\sigma &\sim \mathrm{Exponential}(1)

Where $z(\cdot)$ denotes standardized variables.

The model for the probability $p_a$ of having entered a new field:

    \beta,\mu &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\
    |\mu^{\text{area}}_k| &\sim \mathrm{Exponential}(\tau)\\

% \section{\label{appendix:macro}Macroscopic transfers}

\subsection{\label{appendix:cases}Exploring individual careers}

 Tables \ref{table:low_change} and \ref{table:top_change} show the 20 most conservative and least conservative physicists. Measures of the diversity of intellectual capital ($D(\bm{I_a})$) and social capital ($D(\bm{S_a})$) are included. Table \ref{table:low_change} shows the physicists who have been the most conservative towards their research agenda. Interestingly, 15 out of 20 are specialized in ``Collider physics'', in line with the above observation that this particular research area is more specialized.
% ``Neutrinos and flavor physics'' occurs several times as well. This might seem contradicting with the finding that this research area is associated with higher change scores. However, Neutrinos physics remains a significant research area to which many physicists are still committed. For instance, S.~Goswami's started her career in the late 1990s, working on neutrinos oscillations \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srubabati_Goswami}} and has remained dedicated to this research area after what she describes as the ``golden age'' of neutrino physics (i.e. the early 2000s, \footnote{\url{https://www.ias.ac.in/public/Resources/Initiatives/Women_in_Science/Contributors/srubabati.pdf}}).
%Moreover, although the investigation of the ``Electroweak sector'' has mostly relied on particle accelerators, it is noteworthy that physicists specialized in the former research area have more effectively taken the turn to the investigation of Dark matter. This suggests that converting knowledge of the phenomenology of the the electroweak sector to the study of dark matter is easier than re-adapting knowledge specific to particle accelerators to this end. 

Table \ref{table:top_change} shows the 10 physicists with the highest change scores.  Looking into the share of attention dedicated by each scientist to each area, one can see that high change scores are usually reached, unsurprisingly, when physicists exit a research area and enter a new one in which they had almost no prior interest. 

In order to make sure that these cases of high migration were not false positives due to the failure to properly disambiguate authors, we have inspected each of them manually, by comparing physicists' Inspire HEP profiles with data from their personal websites, as well as their university or LinkedIn profiles. We found one of them to be a false positive due to failing author disambiguation, namely ``T.~Fuchs'', i.e. the author with the highest change score. In the case of S.~D.~Katz, certain publications were excluded due to inaccurate classifications in the database, which has led to overestimate their initial distribution of dark matter research. All other cases are accurate.
%For instance, physicist M.~Redi can be seen to have moved away from Quantum gravity research toward the investigation of Dark matter. And indeed, his personal web-page reads: ``I have worked in several different fields of theoretical physics from extra-dimensional theories to supersymmetry and modifications of gravity. My main interest at the moment is phenomenology but I keep interests in more formal subjects such us strongly coupled dynamics [\dots] I am currently mostly working on cosmology, dark matter theories and gravitational waves'' \footnote{\url{https://sites.google.com/site/redi76/research}, accessed on 11/10/2023}.
For instance, on G.~Ferretti's university webpage, one can read: ``Gabriele Ferretti joined Chalmers in 1999. For the first ten years he has been mainly involved in research in quantum field theory and string theory with emphasis on their formal aspects. Since the start of the LHC he has also become interested in phenomenological applications of quantum field theory and model building'' \footnote{\url{https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/ferretti/}, accessed on 11/10/2023}.

Comparing tables \ref{table:low_change} and \ref{table:top_change}, one can see that physicists with high change scores tend to have much more diverse intellectual and social capital. In other words, such physicists have had more opportunities to adapt or revise their research agenda. This is in line with the observation that change is enhanced by the diversity of cognitive resources one has access to.

\subsection{\label{appendix:hep_vs_acl}Replication corpus}

For purposes of replication, certain analyses have been reproduced on the ACL anthology corpus of Computational Linguistics research \citep{acl_anthology_corpus}. A comparison with the \gls{hep} corpus in shown in Table \ref{table:corpora}. The ACL corpus is smaller, presumably due to a lack of exhaustivity. The requirement on the quantity of publications has been lowered (three per time period instead of five) in order to maintain a reasonable size of cohort. The choice of time periods is arbitrary (i.e. it was not informed by the context). Only 14 topics were deemed to carry scientifically meaningful content upon manual inspection. 

\input{tables/hep_vs_acl}

The transfers of attention are shown in Figure \ref{fig:sankey_acl}. Compared to the high-energy physics corpus, it features significant disruptions (e.g., the emergence of new topics, such as ``deep learning'', ``sentiment analysis'' and ``embeddings \& pre-trained models'').

 \begin{figure}[h]

% Similarly, Figure \ref{fig:turns_strings_bh} shows the trajectories of the two physicists with the most striking turn from String theory and supergravity to Black holes. Physicist C has seemingly exited String theory to focus on Black holes (which was already part of his research agenda) but also AdS/CFT; this is therefore an emblematic example of the trend discussed above. Physicist D is a more senior scientist toward the end of his career, with fewer publications in the late period.

% \subsection{\label{appendix:outcomes}Model of citations outcomes}

% The assumed causal model is represented in Figure \ref{fig:outcomes_causal_dag}. It is assumed that the late success of scientists, measured by $h_a^{F}$, is a linear function of: i) their initial performance $h_a^{I}$; ii) how many years they have been active during the first period ($\tau_a$); iii) $\bm{x_a}$, i.e. their research agenda during the initial period; and finally, iv) the transfers in research attention, as measured by $\bm{x_a}$ and $(\theta_{akk'})$:

%     \caption{\textbf{Relationship between research performance and changes in the research agenda}. Research performance is evaluated as the partial h-index calculated for the initial time period ($h_a^I$) and the final time period ($h_a^F$). The proficiency of scientists is defined as how their performance (in terms of h-index) in the first period compares to that of scientists with an identical research portfolio $\bm{x_a}$ and years of activity $\tau_a$. Later success ($h_a^F$) is also influenced by the kind of knowledge that may have been converted and adapted to new research areas, which is indirectly measured by $(x_{ak})$, $(y_{ak})$ and $(\theta_{akk'})$. Proficiency acts as a confounder since it also influences the choice of certain research areas and the decision/ability to switch to new topics (as exhibited by the dashed arrow). }

% \subsection{\label{appendix:knowledge}Supplementary model: measuring the effect of specific knowledge on transfers between research areas}

% The model introduced in Section \ref{sec:model} can be modified to incorporate any kind of covariate. To illustrate this, this section proposes a model where the covariate $\bm{Z_a}$ is a vector in the word-embedding space that represents the knowledge of each physicist. The goal of this model is to better understand what bits of knowledge have increased the ability/tendency of physicists to leave certain research areas for others. 

% The knowledge vector is constructed as follows. A bag-of-keywords $b_{aw}$ is constructed based on the abstracts of each scientist' publications, excluding those with more than two authors. $b_{aw}$ defined as the number of times the author $a$ has used the keyword $w$ in the abstracts of their publications. Only keywords that carry specialized knowledge (i.e., those whose topic probability distribution entropy is lesser than $\log 2$) are included. A tf-idf transformation is then applied to the bag of words, resulting in a new matrix $b'_{aw}$. Finally, the knowledge vector is the mean embedding calculated form the transformed bag-of-words:

% \begin{equation}
%     \bm{Z_{a}} = \dfrac{\sum_w b'_{aw} \bm{v_{w}}}{\sum_w b'_{aw}} 
% \end{equation}

% Where $\bm{v_w}\in\mathbb{R}^{L}$ is the vector representation of the keyword $w$ (in the embedding space used to train the topic model). 

% Equation \eqref{eq:glm} from Section \ref{sec:model} is then modified as follows:

% \begin{equation}
%     \bm{\theta_{ak}} = \text{softmax}\left(\beta_{ak1} + \bm{\gamma_{k1}}\cdot \bm{Z_{a}}, \dots,\beta_{akK} +  \bm{\gamma_{kK}}\cdot \bm{Z_{a}} \right)
% \end{equation}

% The vectors $\gamma_{kk'}$ are learned via gradient descent on the log-likelihood of the model.

% Keywords $w$ that maximize the probability to leave $k$ for $k'$ are those that maximize $(\text{idf}(w) \bm{v_w}) \cdot (\bm{\gamma_{kk'}}-\sum_{i \neq k'}\bm{\gamma_{ki}})$. These are shown in Table \ref{table:largest_transfers}.
% Keywords that maximize the commitment to $k$ are those that maximize $ (\text{idf}(w) \bm{v_w}) \cdot (\bm{\gamma_{kk}}-\sum_{k' \neq k}\bm{\gamma_{kk'}})$. They are shown in Table \ref{table:most_conservative}.
