\begin{abstract}
    Scientists must navigate between the need to capitalize on their prior knowledge by specializing in a few topics, and the need to adapt to evolving research opportunities. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach for unveiling transformations in scientists' research portfolios in response to changes in their field, and the effect of their intellectual, social, and institutional resources (i.e. capital, as per Bourdieu) on their trajectories. The proposed methodology is applied to high-energy physics from years 2000 to 2020, as the field was confronted with the null results of a major particle collider and the emergence of new astrophysical experiments. The analysis reveals major shifts from the physics of neutrinos and the electroweak sector toward dark matter, and from string theory to black holes and the holographic principle. Moreover, two dimensions of social capital, namely ``diversity'' and ``power'', have opposite effects on the magnitude of change in research interests: while ``diversity'' tends to disrupt research interests, ``power'' stabilizes the physicists' research agenda -- as does institutional stability. Social capital is more crucial to shifts between more cognitively distant research areas. Outcomes of scientists' trajectories are explored, highlighting the relative success of different strategies in terms of scientific credit (citations), and thus the incentives for adaptation.

\section{Introduction}

Scientists are subject to conflicting incentives. On the one hand, they must work within the realm of their expertise, where they can most effectively exploit their prior knowledge and compete with other experts; such a conservative preference for familiar research topics is at the root of specialization. On the other hand, scientists are simultaneously compelled to revise their research agenda and engage with increasingly promising research areas to which they might not be as acquainted, in order to benefit from more exposure, to secure more perennial funding for their work, or to seize job opportunities. Thus, in some instances, specialization may be at odd with the need to adapt to the decay of certain research opportunities and the growth of new ones. Therefore, we may ask: how scientists navigate the trade-off between specialization and adaptation? This conflict is in some respect similar to the ``essential tension'' between ``tradition'' and ``innovation'' proposed by \citet{Kuhn1997}, or that between ``exploration'' and ``exploitation'' proposed by \citet{March1991}, which have been explored quantitatively in previous works \citep{Foster2015,Jia2017,Aleta2019,Zeng2019,Tripodi2020,Chakresh2023,Feifan2023}\footnote{See also the sampling-specialization trade-off, in an evolutionary setting \citep{Frankenhuis2011}}. The balance between ``specialization'' and ``adaptation'', however, must be distinguished from the balance between normal, incremental science on one hand, and the risky exploration of uncharted territories on the other, in \citet{Foster2015}. In particular, ``adaptation'' is not tantamount to innovation or disruption, for ``adaptation'' can be a conformist move (e.g., as a result of a band-wagon effect, cf. \citealt{Fujimura1988}, or a continued enterprise of ``normal science'', albeit applied to new epistemic goals. Thus, the present paper focuses on what enables individuals to adapt and which kinds of knowledge promote adaptation. The central assumption is that scientists' ability to adapt (and survive) within a changing epistemic environment depends primarily on two kinds of resources they can mobilize to this end, namely intellectual and social capital. We develop a coherent Bayesian approach inspired from ecological inference for analyzing changes in scientists' research agenda in response to transformations in their field, while measuring the effect of ``capital'' (intellectual or social) on their individual trajectories. We apply it to a cohort of high-energy physicists between the years 2000 and 2020, as the historical driver of progress in the field -- particle accelerators -- are now being contested by emerging astrophysical experiments, thus redefining the landscape of opportunities. Yet, high-energy physics remains one of the most specialized subfields within physics, raising questions about its ability to adapt \citep{Battiston2019,Aleta2019}.

Our approach first reveals trends in the field: the boom of dark matter, fueled by migrations away from the physics of neutrinos and the electroweak sector, and the disintegration of string theory into the study of black holes and the holographic principle. Beyond revealing these transfers of knowledge, the analysis demonstrates that two dimensions of social capital, namely ``diversity'' and ``power''  -- building upon the distinction made by \citet{Abbasi2014} --, have opposite effects on change. While ``diversity'' of social capital (that is, the extent to which scientists have access to diverse cognitive resources via their collaborators) promotes change and further diversification of scientists' research interests, ``power'' (roughly speaking, how many collaborators scientists have) enhances the stability of research interests. We also find that social capital has a stronger effect on transfers between research areas that are more cognitively ``distant''. Moreover, institutional stability is found to stabilize research interests. More fundamentally, we also show that changes in the scientists' research interests tend to minimize learning costs at the level of the community. Finally, by analyzing outcomes (in terms of the h-index), we show that the ``turn to the cosmos'' has paid off, in particular for physicists who previously specialized in String theory \& supergravity and those who previously focused on neutrino physics. Overall, the present contribution has three components: i) a theoretical component, by proposing fundamental features of change in scientists' research interests; ii) a methodological dimension, through the elaboration of statistical models for studying scientists' trajectories, and proposed measures of intellectual capital, social capital, diversity, and power; and finally, iii) an empirical component, by documenting the case of high-energy physics and its transformations.

The paper is structured as follows. In the rest of the introduction, Section \ref{sec:conceptual} summarizes previous research and lays out the conceptual background on which rests the proposed analysis, and Section \ref{sec:hep} introduces the context of high-energy physics to which we apply the contributed methodology. %; and Section \ref{sec:hypotheses} summarises the hypotheses that will be evaluated throughout the paper.
Section \ref{sec:methods} elaborates the methodology, starting with the data used in the paper (\ref{sec:data}), followed by the topic model approach for measuring the contribution of authors to each ``research area'' (\ref{sec:topics}), the developed measures of intellectual and social ``capital'' (\ref{sec:capital}), and, finally, the model for scientists' individual trajectories (\ref{sec:model}).
Section \ref{sec:results} then proceeds with the results: i) the aggregate transfers of attention between research areas at the level of the community (\ref{sec:macro}); ii) the magnitude of changes in scientists' research agenda and how it is affected by capital (intellectual and social) and position stability (\ref{sec:magnitude}); iii) an exploration of interesting cases (\ref{sec:cases}). Finally, we explore the outcomes of scientists' trajectories (\ref{sec:outcomes}) as evidence for the incentives they receive to adapt and/or the relative success of different strategies. 


\subsection{\label{sec:conceptual}Empirical and conceptual background}

Changes in the research topics explored by scientists throughout their careers has been the focus on several previous works. For instance, by mapping the trajectories of 103,246 physicists over 26 years using the American Physical Society (APS) dataset and its topic classification (the \gls{pacs}), \citet{Aleta2019} have demonstrated that physicists usually work on different topics by the end of their career while often remaining within the same general area, with change in research topics typically unfolding gradually over the years. They reveal differences between sub-fields of physics, such that ``exploitation'' (i.e. specialization, by opposition to the ``exploration'' of new topics) is especially more prevalent in particle and nuclear physics.  Using the same data, \citet{Jia2017} find an exponentially decaying distribution of changes in scientists' interests, a result that seems at odd with \citealt{Aleta2019}\footnote{This discrepancy could be explained by the different decisions these authors made regarding which physicists should be included in their analysis (depending on their publication counts) and which papers to include in the estimates of ``initial'' and ``final'' research areas}. They also find that physicists tend to investigate a few core topics quite frequently, as well as many ``peripheral'' topics less frequently. They show that physicists are more likely to investigate topics that they have worked on recently, or topics more similar to those they have previously explored. \citet{Jia2017} also proposed several models to account for the observed patterns of changes in research topics. For instance, they show that a model in which scientists draw combinations of ideas from a topic pool that itself drifts gradually can qualitatively reproduce the observed distribution of changes in research interests. All these findings emphasize the graduality of changes in research topics, in line with a much less recent observation from \citet{Gieryn1978} that astronomers were most likely to alter their research agenda incrementally. Recognizing that scientists typically investigate several research questions at the same time, \citeauthor{Gieryn1978} proposed four mechanisms of gradual change: ``accretion'' (a problem is added to the problem set),  ``selective substitution'' (one problem is replaced by another in the problem set), or ``selective disengagement'' (one problem is dropped from the problem set). Much more recently, \citet{Zeng2019} have analyzed the frequency of topic switching throughout scientific careers and its association with research performance (in terms of citations), where topics were retrieved from clusters identified in the co-citation network; and others have also proposed mechanical models of topic change \citep{Chakresh2023,Feifan2023}.

All these works are very valuable for understanding the structure of changes in scientists' interests. %Overall, they show that i) problem change is gradual, and that ii) it involves different scales, such that scientists can investigate different problems while remaining in the same broad research area and/or preserving certain ``core interests''.
However, they do not relate changes in scientists' research agendas to changes in the epistemic and institutional context, to the incentives that scientists receive, or to the resources that they can leverage in order to broaden their research opportunities. In particular, they do not explain differences in physicists' behaviors, except in terms of their sub-field of origin or their academic age \citep{Zeng2019,Aleta2019}. \citet{Tripodi2020} have achieved a tremendous step in this direction, using the APS dataset. In their paper, \citeauthor{Tripodi2020} model the probability that physicists have been involved or not in various areas of physics given i) the proximity of these areas to their core-interests and ii) whether they have collaborators with expertise in those areas (``social-relatedness''). They show that both factors significantly increase this probability, and that social-relatedness is an even stronger factor as the cognitive distance from the scientists' core specialization increases; generally, their work underlines the crucial importance of collaboration in the expansion of research portfolios. Moreover, their regressions includes other variables such as scientists' amount of publications and co-authors, the popularity of the target sub-field, differences in citations between the core and target sub-field. They find that amount of co-authors is generally associated with negative probability of diversification to a given sub-field; in contrast, popularity and relative citations are positively associated. However, \citeauthor{Tripodi2020} do not address the \textit{transformations} of scientists research portfolios throughout time (i.e., they do not quantify change), and they recognize the need for further longitudinal analyses.

This paper complements these previous work in several ways. First, since the focus is put on the investigation of \textit{adaptation versus conservatism}, the core of our approach is both comparative (as in \citealt{Tripodi2020}, and unlike previous works) \textit{and} longitudinal (unlike \citealt{Tripodi2020}, although the paper includes longitudinal robustness checks). Second, this contribution evaluates previously unexplored aspects, such as: the choice between expansion or consolidation of research portfolios; the effect institutional stability on change; the evaluation of the outcomes (in terms of citations) of different strategies.   Third, this work relates the findings to the epistemic context of the field and its transformations, which is made possible by performing the analysis at a smaller scale (high-energy physics alone, rather than physics as a whole). Fourth, this work does \textit{not} rely on the APS dataset and \gls{pacs} categories unlike most previous works \citep{Jia2017,Aleta2019,,Battiston2019,Tripodi2020,Chakresh2023,Feifan2023}. A different dataset is used, and research areas are clustered with a topic model, such that the contributed methodology can in principle be applied to any body of scientific literature. Finally, the proposed approach is grounded in theory, by translating concepts such as capital \citep{Bourdieu1980,Bourdieu1986} into quantitative constructs. Below, the conceptual framework underlying the present paper is introduced.

%Why scientists respond differently to changes in their environment over time?
The problem of scientists' adaptation to a changing epistemic landscape can be compared to that of the adaptation of institutions under changing circumstances. %, and it is useful to take a little detour via the literature addressing the later question for two reasons.  One is methodological: in order to investigate what influences physicists trajectories, we will compare the evolution of the research focus of high-energy physicists between two time-periods. Our approach is therefore similar to that of ``comparative historical analysis'', which is central to studies of institutional change \citep{Mahoney2015}. More importantly,
Indeed, as shown in previous works on the transformations of high-energy physics facilities to multi-purpose photon-science instruments  \citep{Hallonsten2013,Heinze2017a}, the framework of historical institutionalism can account for gradual adaptations with large cumulative effects taking place in response to scientific and technological change \citep{Heinze2012}. While these works have documented the adaptation of \textit{organizations} in response to change, the present paper makes a little leap and applies these concepts \textit{individuals} themselves.
%  and has to do with the dual nature of change and self-perpetuation that has been addressed by historical institutionalism and that provides concepts relevant to scientific change as we will argue below
Just like institutional change can be constrained by past arrangements, scientists' careers exhibit some level of path-dependency as early-career decisions can have a lasting effect. Path-dependency is a natural consequence of ``increasing returns'' \footnote{See \citealt{Pierson2000} for a discussion of path-dependency and increasing returns in the contexts of economics and politics.} that arise when perpetuating certain options yields increasing gains. One driver of increasing returns in academia are the large costs of entry \citep{Pierson2000} in a given a research area: students must accumulate a lot of knowledge before being able to compete with peers. 
Yet, in the context of historical institutionalism, it has been argued that the importance of path-dependency should not be overstated: although institutions tend to feature path-dependency, the process through which they ``survive'' over long periods of time often requires continuous change\footnote{``The language of stasis and inertia is particularly unhappy because as the world around institutions is changing their survival will not necessarily rest on the faithful reproduction of those institutions as originally constituted, but rather on their ongoing active adaptation to changes in the political and economic environment in which they are embedded.'' \citep[p.~293]{Thelen2004}} that may in fact cumulatively add up to significant transformations and even transgress their initial purposes. Similarly, although scientists' prior knowledge effectively constrains their opportunities, its exploitation may require a sustained process of change, unfolding gradually, by progressively re-purposing this knowledge to new ends, by incorporating complementary bits knowledge, or by discarding others. Such gradual moves allow scientists to strategically retain some of  the benefits of ``problem retention'' (e.g., the exploitation of ``accumulated skills and resources'' in one area, or ``of an established research network'', \citealt[p.~106]{Gieryn1978}) while progressively investing resources in new research directions.
%Another source of positive-feedback are \textit{learning effects}; and again, in scientific research, increased knowledge 

%As a result of these effects, the costs of moving to new research areas can be higher than the benefits of switching.


 % Although institutions also tend to feature path-dependency, whereby the outcome of ``previous [political] battles'' may have a lasting effect \citep{Thelen2004}, the process through which institutions ``survive'' over long periods of time often requires continuous change\footnote{``The language of stasis and inertia is particularly unhappy because as the world around institutions is changing their survival will not necessarily rest on the faithful reproduction of those institutions as originally constituted, but rather on their ongoing active adaptation to changes in the political and economic environment in which they are embedded'', \citep[p.~293]{Thelen2004}}. 
 % Similarly, although it is plausible that scientists' prior knowledge effectively constrains their opportunities and therefore later career developments (thus exhibiting some level of ``path-dependency''), it might also be that scientists' cultivation of their knowledge capital requires a sustained process of change, either by re-purposing their knowledge to new ends of higher perceived epistemic or social value, by incorporating complementary bits knowledge, or by abandoning certain ideas or methods.


Figure \ref{fig:research-agenda} illustrates how scientists can reshape their research agenda portfolio, e.g. for seizing new research opportunities, while taking advantage of their own prior knowledge base as much possible. It represents the research agenda of a scientist in two separate time-periods, in terms of the resources they utilize and to what research areas these resources are applied. Resources are to be understood broadly: they might be concepts, models, methods, or technical skills mastered by a researcher. Problem areas are designated by different colors. A resource can be simultaneously applied to different ends, as expressed (see hatched rectangles); however, resources are typically tailored and fit for specific research areas. Scientists can take advantage of their prior knowledge in different ways. They can of course embrace specialization and keep pursuing similar problems with the same theoretical and methodological tools.  Alternatively, they can apply their prior knowledge to new purposes; this is akin to what \citet{schon1963displacement} calls ``concept displacement'' and such a strategy can be leveraged to enter new research areas \citep{Mulkay1974}. We call it ``\textit{conversion}'', in reference to the typology of incremental institutional change proposed by \citet{mahoney_thelen_2009}. Of course, not all intellectual or methodological resources can be successfully applied to new research areas; in fact, scientists are more likely to shift resources and attention to research areas that are less ``cognitively distant'' to their previous expertise. Overall, we expect that scientists build up as much as possible on their prior knowledge, thereby reinforcing the continuity in the evolution of their research agenda.

However, prior knowledge can be insufficient. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:research-agenda}, entering new research areas typically requires ``\textit{layering}'' (here again, borrowing the terminology from historical institutionalism), i.e. the introduction of new concepts, models, or methods, on-top of other intellectual resources. Yet, acquiring new knowledge and skills comes at a cost. In practice, scientists may avoid such learning costs by collaborating with experts in the target domain \citep{Tripodi2020}. Other modes of change (besides layering and conversion) can be considered; e.g. \textit{displacement} (by replacing a research area with another, with little or no preservation of prior knowledge). % or \textit{dismantling} (by abandoning a body of knowledge altogether).
Displacement may not be the preferred strategy, since it fails to take advantage of accumulated knowledge; however, certain bodies of knowledge can sometimes fail to apply in a new context; or, sometimes there might be strong reasons to suspend a kind of research in order to concentrate resources and attention to more promising research areas.

We have discussed two resources that scientists can leverage to navigate the trade-off between specialization and adaptation. The first is their own prior expertise, which enables them to compete in research areas where these intellectual resources are either necessary or scarce and relevant. The second is the expertise to which they potentially have access via their social network. We propose to view both these resources as ``capital'' \citep{Bourdieu1986} that can be leveraged in a changing epistemic landscape, where boundaries across specializations must be crossed. Bourdieu's ``capital'' designates assets of different kinds that individuals (e.g. scientists) can accumulate and leverage in the competitive context of their field. It is indeed ``capital''  (whether ``economic'', ``cultural'', ``social'' or even ``symbolic'', cf. \citealt{Bourdieu1986}) that defines the scope of scientists' opportunities, and therefore their ability to broaden their research agenda. This paper considers the \textit{cultural capital} possessed by scientists in the form of scientific knowledge (which will be referred to as ``intellectual capital''), and \textit{social capital}. Measures that operationalize these concepts will be proposed, and their effect on the magnitude of transfers of attention across research areas will be evaluated. Emphasis will be put on the divide underlined by \citet{Abbasi2014} between two dimensions of social capital, namely ``power'' (in fact, network size) and ``diversity'' (in this paper specifically, that of a group's cognitive resources). Diversity is generally recognized as a factor of adaptation in an evolving environment \citep{Schimmelpfennig2021,Muthukrishna2016,Henrich2004} or in the context of problem-solving \citep{Hong2004}. Power, status and prestige, too, are plausibly associated with higher abilities.

Although capital defines scientists' opportunities, it is not sufficient to explain \textit{why} physicists \textit{do} turn to new research areas or not, which also requires to understand the incentives that actors receive and why they must respond to these incentives. Consequently, the present paper also considers the effect of position stability on migrations between research areas, given that the need to respond to changes in the epistemic and institutional environment is presumably different for physicists applying to new jobs than it is for tenured professors and researchers. Moreover, the outcomes (in terms of citations) of various trajectories will be compared.

Before introducing the data and the quantitative approach developed in this paper, recent developments in high-energy physics, and the motivations for applying the approach to this field of physics are briefly discussed. 

% For instance, in a case-study, \citet{Mulkay1974} discusses the role of ``concept displacement'' in the migration of radio-astronomers to new research communities. 



\subsection{\label{sec:hep}The case of high-energy physics: navigating a changing epistemic landscape}

Historically, the field of particle physics has relied on experimental input from larger and larger particle colliders in order to achieve progress. Such efforts have culminated in 2010 with the start of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which has essentially superseded its predecessors. With about  10,000 collaborators, it is the largest particle accelerator ever built. However, the LHC has found no evidence for anything that was not already predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics, and it is increasingly plausible that in fact no conceivable particle accelerator would ever find any evidence for new particles or phenomena, resulting in a ``crisis'' in particle physics \citep{susy_crisis}. Although the \gls{lhc} will continue taking data for years, and plans for future accelerators are being discussed \citep{Roser2023}, some have even speculated that particle physics as we know it had come to an end \citep{Harlander2023,Kosyakov2023}\footnote{As \citet{Harlander2023} put it, ``we [\dots] have to face the possibility that the age of particle discoveries as we know them today is over''.}, ``the proscenium
[being] captured by astrophysics and cosmology'' instead \citep{Kosyakov2023}. In a recent assessment of the state of the field, physicist Mikhail Shifman claimed that ``pause in accelerator programs we are witnessing now is not necessarily [\dots] the end of explorations at short distances [at high energies]''; instead, such explorations ``will continue, perhaps in a new form, with novel devices, and at a different pace'' \citep{Shifman2020}. Indeed, new experimental opportunities have emerged in the meantime. The era of Gravitational Waves astronomy has begun in 2016, with the announcement of the first ``direct'' detection of such waves from a black-hole merger by LIGO \citep{Abbott2016}. Direct searches of dark matter of astrophysical origin, with the LUX and Xenon experiments, have also given access to phenomenal domains relevant to high-energy physics otherwise inaccessible in accelerators\footnote{Dark matter can be detected in particle colliders as missing energy but only to the extent that it can be produced in collisions of visible matter particles.}, and the Planck observatory \citep{planck2011planck} have provided more precise data about dark matter and the early universe. %These transformations in the landscape of experimental opportunities in high-energy physics can be visualized in Figure \ref{fig:experiments}. This Figure shows the share of citations received by the most cited experiments in high-energy physics. It shows the dominance of the Large Hadron Collider in accelerator-based research since its start in 2010. Indeed, investigating higher energies requires such large experiments that their can be no contender to the \gls{lhc}. Moreover, Figure \ref{fig:experiments} reveals the emergence of probes of astrophysical phenomena in \gls{hep}, e.g. the cosmic microwave background (which provides information about dark matter and early universe physics), gravitational waves and direct dark matter detection. Another phenomenon of interest the declining interest in neutrino experiments since the early 2000s, especially in experiments studying non-astrophysical neutrinos\footnote{The Super-Kamiokande experiment and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory found conclusive evidence for neutrino oscillations in 1998 and 2001 respectively. Takaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald were awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics for these discoveries (\url{https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2017/09/advanced-physicsprize2015.pdf}).}. 
In fact, astrophysics seem to be increasingly replacing the physics of particle colliders in the exchanges of knowledge between experimentally inclined phenomenologists and more mathematically inclined theorists \citep{Gautheron2023}.

In what follows, we propose to investigate how high-energy physicists have adapted in reaction to these changes in the scientific landscape in the first two decades of the 21st century. In doing so, we aim to explore the contribution of different factors that may have affected the trajectories of individual physicists: what explains why certain physicists have moved on to other topics, while others have pursued similar interests instead? 


% \subsection{\label{sec:hypotheses}Hypotheses}

% We propose to make our hypotheses more explicit by formulating them into statements amenable to statistical testing. Our guiding hypotheses will be:


% \begin{itemize}
%     \item[\textbf{H1}] Scientists with broader intellectual resources (capital) tend to change their portfolio more often.
%     \item[\textbf{H2}] Scientists with enhances social resources (capital) tend to change their portfolio more often:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item[\textbf{H2a}] Scientists with more diverse social capital tend to change their research agenda more.
%         \item[\textbf{H2b}] Scientists with more collaborators tend to change their research agenda more
%         \item[\textbf{H2c}] Scientists with more access to intellectual resources in certain research areas via their collaborators are more likely to commit further resources to these specific research areas.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item[\textbf{H3}] position stability has an effect on physicists' tendency to change their research agenda:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item[\textbf{H3a}] Scientists with tenured/stable positions change their research agenda more (e.g. because they have more ability to choose their research topics or to take risks).
%         \item[\textbf{H3b}] Scientists with tenured/stable positions are more conservative toward their research agenda (e.g. because they have less incentives/pressure to change it).
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item[\textbf{H4}] Physicists who committed to high-energy astrophysics in the late 2010s have received more scientific credit compared to the others
% \end{itemize}

% Note that our approach will also be exploratory. Beyond hypothesis testing, we aim to unveil transfers of knowledge across research areas in high-energy physics without any assumption about what these transfers might be; in fact, we will employ unsupervised methods (with no training labels) in order to segment the field into distinct research areas, thus leaving the room open for surprises.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item H1: physicists change their research agenda gradually
%     \item H2: it is most natural to switch from one research area to another if they already are associated in the literature
%     \item H3: positive effect of social capital
% \end{itemize}

% TODO: better grounding in i) Bourdieu's notion of capital and ii) the contemporary literature..

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item H1: physicists with higher abilities to establish new collaborations (higher social capital) are more likely to switch to new topics.
%     \item H2: physicists with more prestigious institutional affiliations (higher symbolic capital) have been more likely to invest new topics.
%     \item H3: physicists with more ``credit'' (higher h-index) have a higher chance to invest new topics
%     \item H4: physicists can invest new topics more easily if they have collaborators with expertise in these topics.
%     \item H5: physicists with a more diverse expertise have more ability to invest new topics.
% \end{itemize}

\section{\label{sec:methods}Methods}

\subsection{\label{sec:data}Data}

Our source of data is the Inspire HEP database \citep{InspireAPI}. It aggregates high-energy physics literature from varied sources, including main scientific publishers and arXiv, and has been used in a number of works \citep{Perovi2016,Strumia2021,Sikimi2022,Gautheron2023}. This database is free-access and includes a variety of high-quality data: semantic data about each paper (mainly their title and abstract, sometimes also keywords and \gls{pacs} categories), curated authorship and institutional affiliations, lists of references and experiments associated to each paper. Full-texts are not directly provided, although most of them could in theory be retrieved from arXiv.

The present analysis includes all papers from the categories ``Theory-HEP'' and ``Phenomenology-HEP'' (according to the classification of the database which is itself based on that of the arXiv), to which most  high-energy physics publications belong. Of course, this excludes the minority of purely experimental high-energy physics publications. Patterns of specialization among experimenters would be interesting to study as well; however, experimental papers are typically authored by thousands of collaborators, and authorship data brings no information about individual physicists' specialization. Nevertheless, considering theoretical and phenomenological publications still allows the investigation of how theorists and phenomenologists have adapted to the changes outline above. In total, the corpus includes $D=186,162$ papers published between 2000 and 2019, the time-period investigatedin this paper. 

For the longitudinal analysis, the data is divided into two time-periods. A first phase (2000-2009) is used to infer the initial ``research agenda'' of each physicist of the cohort as well as their intellectual and social capital. A late phase (2015-2019) is used to measure how each physicist's research agenda has shifted since the initial time-period, in the context of the changes outlined above. Only physicists with at least 5 publications during each time-period (2000 to 2009, and 2015 to 2019) are included, resulting in a cohort of $N=2195$ physicists. As a result, this study is limited to physicists that have remained sufficiently dedicated to high-energy physics; what we observe are thus the physicists' strategies for adapting \textit{within} high-energy physics, thus excluding authors that exited the field for instance (survivorship bias). Moreover, this author-inclusion rule based on publication counts excludes scientists that publish very irregularly; even though scientists who publish continuously are a minority, they have a disproportionate impact on their field, which makes them particularly interesting\footnote{According to  \citet{Ioannidis2014}, less than one percent of scientists active in the years 1996–2011 have published every year during this period, and yet this minority is responsible to 47\% of publications. It must be noted that the selection rule is much less stricter, as it allows for gaps in scientists' publication history, as in \citealt{Feifan2023}, where it is found that the 13\% of physicists with more than 16 publications over the course of 24 years account for 82\% of publications.}. In any case, we do not seek ``representativeness'': we only aim to achieve enough variance to uncover patterns among this particular cohort of productive high-energy physicists. The median academic age of the physicists in the cohort is 23 years (in 2015), and 49\% of them have had an affiliation that spanned the whole time-period (full distributions are shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:sample_characteristics}, Figure \ref{fig:sample_characteristics}). Let us stress that bibliometric databases for analyzing scientists' careers can be challenging due to authors with identical names being mistaken with one another, or authors with names spelled in different ways incorrectly identified as separate individuals. Fortunately, the Inspire HEP database implements both automatized and manual measures for the disambiguation of author names\footnote{Besides the use of ``advance algorithms'' of author-disambiguation, Inspire allows and invites scientists to correct their publication record on the website (``Background	information	on	the	INSPIRE	website'', June 2014, \url{https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/Inspire/WebHome/INSPIRE_background.pdf})}. %-- authors are given the opportunity to correct their records, and they have an incentive to do so.
This has allowed \citet{Strumia2021} to analyze gender gaps in physicists' research careers based on these data. Nevertheless, occasional misidentifications remain possible.

\subsection{\label{sec:topics}Measuring research agendas}

The first step is to evaluate how much attention physicists have devoted to each research area during each time-period. In contrast to \citealt{Jia2017,Battiston2019,Aleta2019,Tripodi2020}, this approach does not rely on \gls{pacs} categories: those are only sparsely available among Inspire HEP records, and this would make the approach inapplicable to contexts other than physics. Instead, research areas are extracted through the use of a topic model, which simultaneously recovers latent ``topics'' within the corpus and their vocabulary distributions.  Given research areas should be rather broad and autononomous, we perform a coarse-grained classification of the literature into only $K=20$ ``topics''. One could consider a finer-grained classification, and there is always some level of arbitrariness involved in choosing the amount of topics. This is not as much an issue of topic models themselves: as \citet{Gieryn1978} puts it, ``in such analyses [of problem change], empirical findings will in part reflect the defined scope of problem areas'', which is itself arbitrary. In fact, that topic models give some control over the cognitive scale can be considered a feature, rather than a bug\footnote{In fact, previous works based on the \gls{pacs} categories have leveraged the different levels of this hierarchical classification system to investigate different scales. }.

In order to perform the clustering task, we use the \gls{etm} developed by \citealt{Dieng2020}, which relies on pre-trained embeddings representations of the keywords. This model provides more reliable classifications of heavy-tailed vocabulary distributions%\footnote{For rarely occurring keywords, meaning can be better inferred by taking advantage of their proximity with other keywords within documents, which is precisely the kind of information that word-embeddings encode. Traditional topic models dismiss all information about the relative position of keywords.}
, which is especially important in our case, since we seek accurate estimates of the amount of keywords in each abstract that belong to each ``topic''. We train the model on the whole corpus (all $D=186,162$ documents published between 2000 and 2019). Keywords are extracted from the papers' titles and abstracts by filtering n-grams between one and three words matching certain syntactic expressions that we can expect to carry scientific information (by designating concepts, models, methds etc.), following the procedure described in \citealt{Gautheron2023} and \citealt{omodei_tel-01097702}. Keywords' embeddings are learned using a skip-grap model in a 50 dimension space (few dimensions are needed given the small size of the vocabulary, $V=4,751$). In the end, we obtain the topics listed in table \ref{table:research_areas}. This table shows their most-frequent keywords, as well as the \gls{pacs} categories that are most correlated with them, for purposes of validation. Of the 20 resulting topics, 16 topics are interpretable; the other four seem to regroup keywords that do not clearly refer to any specific research area (e.g. ``paper'', ``approach''). As is apparent in the table, these four topics correlate poorly with the \gls{pacs} categories, thus confirming their lack of scientific dimension. As a result, we exclude them from the rest of the present analysis, and we only consider the remaining $K=16$ topics that actually designate research areas.

The next step is to go through all papers and estimate their contribution to each research area. In the \gls{etm} -- as in topic models in general--, documents are mixtures of several topics; moreover, keywords may belong to several topics. This is a desirable feature, because certain concepts serve different purposes depending on the context, and some concepts do not clearly belong to any research area. More importantly, this is crucial to the present approach, insofar we must be sensitive to situations in which scientists have repurposed certain concepts to new research goals; i.e., instances where the same resources are applied in a new context (a new research area). %The variational inference algorithm in \citet{Dieng2020} marginalises out the topic of each word occurrence during training.
For that, each keyword $i$ from a document $d$ is assigned a research area $z_{di} := \argmax_{k=1,\dots,K} P(z_{di}=k|w_{di},\bm{\theta}_{d})$, which is the research area most probably associated with the keyword $i$ given the topic-distribution of the document $\bm{\theta}_d$ -- i.e. the context (see Appendix \ref{appendix:keywords} for further details).

From the values $z_{di}$, we can then recover $X_{a,k}$, the amount of times resources (concepts, models, methods, etc.) in papers (co-)authored by $a$ were applied in the context of a research area $k$ in the initial time-period (2000 to 2009). Mathematically, $X_{a,k}=\sum_{d\in P,a\in A_d} \sum_i \delta(z_{di},k)$, where $A_d$ is the set of authors of a publication $d$, and $P$ is the set of papers published between 2000 and 2009, and $\delta$ is the Kronecker delta. We then compute a matrix $Y_{a,k}$ using the same procedure, based on publications from the later time-period (2015 to 2019) this time. Finally, from this we define the normalized distributions $x_{ak} \equiv X_{ak}/\sum_{k'} X_{ak'}$ and $y_{ak} \equiv Y_{ak}/\sum_{k'} Y_{ak'}$. They represent how each scientist $a$ divided their attention across research areas during each time-period.

\subsection{\label{sec:capital}Measuring capital}

We aim to evaluate the effect of two resources on scientists' trajectories, namely intellectual and social capital \citep{Bourdieu1986}. An extensive review of prior usage of Bourdieu's notion of capital in bibliometrics has been provided by \citet[p.~198-200]{Schirone2023}, with most references addressing symbolic and social capital, and none focusing on cultural capital. In the following, a consistent approach to intellectual and social capital is proposed; then, measures of diversity and power are derived and compared.

\subsubsection{Intellectual capital}

We propose to represent intellectual capital by a vector $\bm{I_a}=(I_{ak})$ that purportedly measures the proficiency of an author $a$ in each research area $\k \in \{1,\dots,K\}$. It is constructed in a way similar to $\bm{x_{a}}$, summing the contribution of keywords dedicated to each research area in the publications of each author during years 2000 to 2009, except that publications are now weighed differently depending on their amount of authors. Indeed, publications with fewer co-authors convey more information about each author's own expertise. The applied weight is $1 \over |A_d|$, where $|A_d|$ is the amount of authors of publication $d$\footnote{A justification for this weight is that, in a publication with $n$ authors, the probability that any one of them has been responsible for introducing any particular concept or method present in the paper is $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$. }:

\begin{equation}
    I_{ak} \propto  \sum_{d\in P,a\in A_d} \dfrac{1}{|A_d|}\sum_i \delta(z_{di},k)
\end{equation}

The vector $\bm{I_a}$ is normalized, such that $\sum_k I_{ak}=1$; as a result, $\bm{I_a}$ only captures the distribution of knowledge among research instead of the ``absolute magnitude'' of knowledge in each area. This could be justified by asserting that physicists all saturate their cognitive capacities such that the magnitude of their ``total knowledge'' is roughly identical, and that the main difference between them is how they choose to divide their cognitive resources across epistemic domains (for instance, by specializing in one single domain or more). Of course, other measures could in principle be proposed and plugged into the model. 

\subsubsection{Social capital}

A variety of quantitative measures of social capital have been proposed in the context of scientific research \citep{Abbasi2014,Schirone2023}, and their relative relevance must be assessed depending on the phenomenon under investigation. The simplest measure of social capital is the amount of collaborators of a scientist (which amounts to degree centrality in the co-authorship network). More sophisticated weighted variants, that take into consideration the frequency of collaborations, have also been suggested \citep{Abbasi2014}. Other measures are related to the notion of betweeness centrality, which concerns the extent to which an actor ``bridges'' a network. For instance, \citet{BurtBrokerage2007} has proposed to measure social capital in term of brokerage, i.e. the ability of an individual to overcome gaps (``structural holes'') in a social network. The distinction between these different measures is important; in some cases, for instance, redundant contacts are detrimental, and sheer network size can act negatively. \citet{Abbasi2014} distinguishes two general approaches to social capital, depending on whether the emphasis is put on ``power'' versus ``diversity''. They also propose their own measures based on the distribution of scientists' collaborators performance -- as evaluated by their h-index -- and show that these measures correlate better with scientists' performance (i.e. their h-index or citation count) than measures of degree-centrality. All of the measures discussed by \citet{Abbasi2014} are scalars, i.e. they represent social capital as a single number, that is derived from the co-authorship network and sometimes other data (e.g. citations). However, one single number necessarily misses multiple dimensions of social capital, and some of them are not readily captured by social networks alone \citep{MartnAlczar2019}. In fact, according to \citet{Bourdieu1980}, ``the volume of social capital possessed by a particular agent [\dots] depends on the extent of the network of links that he can effectively mobilize, and on the volume of capital (economic, cultural or symbolic) possessed by each of those to whom he is linked''. In that respect, social capital can come in different forms depending on the resources being leveraged via one's network, and which are more relevant depends on the context. In the following, we propose to focus on one aspect of social capital, that is, its intellectual dimension. We propose to represent it by a vector $\bf{S}_{a}$ that encodes how much cognitive resources can be leveraged by scientists \textit{within each} research area by mobilizing their network. %It is a function of i) how many collaborators a scientist has -- as inferred from the co-authorship network --, ii) the strength of these collaborations, and iii) how much expertise each of their collaborators holds in each research area.
More specifically, we define $\bf{S}_{a}$ as the sum of the intellectual capital of $a$'s collaborators, weighted by the strength of their relationship:

\begin{equation}
    \bm{S}_{a} \equiv \sum_{c \in \text{co-authors}(a)} w_{ac} \bm{I}_{c|a}
\end{equation}

The vector $\bm{I}_{c|a}$ is the intellectual capital of $c$, evaluated by excluding papers they co-authored with $a$ (in order to further disentangle the effect of an author's own intellectual capital and intellectual capital available to him in social form). The weight $w_{ac}$, which represents the strength of the relationship between $a$ and $c$, is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    w_{ac} \equiv \max_{d, \{a,c\} \subset A_d} \frac{1}{|A_d|-1}
    \label{eq:weighing_scheme}
\end{equation}

Where $d$ runs over all publications and $A_d$ is the set of the co-authors of a paper $d$. Such a weighing scheme, inspired from \citealt{Newman2004} (eq. 4), captures the fact that a paper with, say, two co-authors, signals a stronger relationship between the authors than a publication with a dozen authors.\footnote{Different assumptions about division of labor within collaborations lead to this expression. For instance, assuming that in a collaboration, each author interacts with a constant amount of co-authors in practice (regardless of the total amount of co-authors), then the probability that they interact with one specific co-author in particular is $\propto \frac{1}{|A_d|-1}$. 
%Alternatively, if authors interact with all their co-authors, but devote a constant amount of time to the collaboration, then the average time spent with each co-author is, again, $\propto \frac{1}{|A_d|-1}$.
} It must be emphasized that Equation \eqref{eq:weighing_scheme}, however, does not take into account the relative frequency of each collaboration, nor their recency.

\subsubsection{Diversity and power}

Although these two constructs ($\bm{I_a}$ and $\bm{S_a}$) operationalizing the notions of intellectual and social capital are vectors (with one dimension per research area), scalar metrics representing ``diversity'' and ``power'' can be derived from them. A common measure of diversity is the Shannon entropy $H$\footnote{The Shannon entropy of the discrete uniform distribution on $\{1,\dots,n\}$ (of probability mass-function $(1/n,\dots,1/n)$) is $\log{n}$, such as that the exponential of the entropy is roughly the effective amount of outcomes for the distribution ($n$).}. Let 
 $D(\bm{I_a})=\exp{H(\bm{I_a})}$ be the diversity of intellectual capital (and $D(\bm{S_a})=\exp{H(\bm{S_a})}$ that of social capital). Roughly speaking, these quantities measure the effective amount of research areas a scientist has access to via their own cognitive resources or those of their collaborators. In the present cohort,  individuals typically have cognitive resources in several research area ($\mu_{D(\bm{I_a})}=6.1,\sigma=2.2$), and social capital is even more diverse ($\mu_{D(\bm{S_a})}=8.5,\sigma=2.2$). In fact, intuitively,  scientific collaborations are expected to empower individual scientists by enabling them to take advantage of their group's cognitive diversity. Moreover, $D(\bm{I_a})$ and $D(\bm{S_a})$ are highly correlated ($R=0.75$); indeed, individuals with more diverse interests are more able to engage with diverse collaborators. However, the diversity of social capital is only expected to enhance individuals' abilities when it exceeds their own intellectual resources. Therefore, in the following, \textit{excess} social capital diversity $D^{\ast}(\bm{S_a})$ is considered; it is defined as the residuals of the linear regression of $D(\bm{S_a})$ against $D(\bm{I_a})$ (by ordinary least squares)\footnote{In their paper, \citet{Tripodi2020} noted the difficulty of determining the direction of the causal relationship between social resources and research interests. This approach aims to overcome the very same challenge.}.

Furthermore, the ``power'' dimension of social capital is evaluated as the \textit{magnitude} of social capital:

\begin{equation}
    M(\bm{S_a})=\sum_k S_{ak} = \sum_{c \in \text{co-authors}(a)} w_{ac}
\end{equation}. The magnitude of social capital is therefore the amount of collaborators weighed by the strength of each relationship, regardless of the diversity or redundancy of their knowledge. % -- here, the logarithm conveys that gains from going from, say, 50 collaborators to 51 collaborators are much lesser than the benefits of going from, say, three to four collaborators. 

Figure \ref{fig:capital_measures} shows the Pearson correlation between these measures of diversity and power, as evaluated on the cohort of high-energy physicists. For comparison purposes, an alternative measure of diversity based on Stirling's index \citep{Stirling2007}, with prior applications to studies of interdisciplinarity \citep{Porter2007,Leahey2016} is evaluated\footnote{The Stirling-based diversity measured is evaluated as: \begin{equation}
    D_{\text{Stirling}} = 1-\sum_{k,k'}d_{kk'}I_{ak}I_{ak'}
\end{equation}

Where $d_{kk'}$ is the fraction of scientists that have more expertise than average in both $k$ and $k'$ among those that have expertise in one or the other (i.e., a similarity matrix).}. A measure of brokerage is also considered\footnote{We evaluated brokerage as the amount of pairs of scientists that have collaborated with a given physicist while having no common collaborator except for this physicist. This effectively measures the extent to which this physicist connects otherwise disconnected scientists.}. 

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:capital_measures}, the entropic measure of diversity considered in this paper correlates strongly with the Stirling measure. The magnitude of social capital (which is similar to degree centrality) correlates weakly with excess social diversity, thus emphasizing that power and diversity are partially orthogonal aspects of social capital. Power is strongly correlated with brokerage; indeed, strongly connected scientists, with higher degree centrality, are also those scientists who initiate collaborations between otherwise disconnected scientist, which is what brokerage captures. Most importantly, brokerage correlates slightly better with measures of intellectual diversity than with excess social diversity. This suggests that the benefits of ``bridging'' positions in social networks can sometimes be confused with the benefits of the actors' own diversity of intellectual resources, which enables them to occupy such positions in the first place. This emphasizes the value of distinguishing the effect of individual intellectual capital from that of social capital. % Nevertheless, brokerage is better correlated to diversity than sheer magnitude, thus demonstrating that different measures of social capital mix up both ``power'' and ``diversity''. Presumably, which dimension of capital (e.g., ``diversity'' or ``power'', per \citealt{Abbasi2014}) matters more depends on the criterion of performance under investigation, and must be assessed empirically.

    \label{fig:capital_measures}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\label{sec:model}Modelling trajectories}

In order to model the physicists' trajectories, we propose a hierarchical multinomial--logistic normal model inspired from the multinomial-dirichlet model for ecological inference by \citet{RosJiaKin01}. Figure \ref{fig:ei} illustrates the intuition underlying this model. It is assumed that how a scientist divides his attention across research areas at a later stage of their career ($\bm{Y_{a}}$) is a function of how they divided their attention initially ($\bm{X_{a}}$); this captures the features of problem change illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:research-agenda}, according to which change in agenda typically involves strategic transfers of knowledge from one research area to another. A more formal representation of the model is given in Figure \ref{fig:model_structure}. It shows that $\bm{Y_{a}}$ is a function of the previous research agenda ($\bm{X_{a}}$), and of a mixing matrix $\theta_a$ that measures the extent to which attention has been re-distributed to different research areas. The matrix $\theta_a$ is drawn from a hierarchical process, thus capturing the ``average'' behavior of the cohort. $\theta_a$ is also a function of co-variates ($\bm{Z_a}$ in Figure \ref{fig:model_structure}), in this case intellectual and social capital, which are supposed to affect how individuals have revised their research agenda. Of course, one could consider the effect of many other covariates; for instance, the effect of holding specific bits of knowledge (models, methods, etc.).

Formally speaking, we assume that $\bm{Y_{a}}$ derives from a multinomial process involving linear combinations of $(x_{ak})$:

\begin{equation}
    \bm{Y_a} \sim \text{multinomial}(\sum_{k=1}^{K} x_{ak}\theta_{ak1} ,\dots,\sum_{k=1}^{K}x_{ak}\theta_{akK})
\end{equation}

Where $\theta_{akk'}$ is the fraction of attention to a topic $k$ that has been redirected to a topic $k'$. %All that is observed are the variables ($\bm{X_{a}}$) and ($\bm{Y_{a}}$) (and co-variates such as intellectual and social capital); however, $\theta$ can be inferred by leveraging the correlations between the attention devoted to a given research area in the initial phase and in the later phase: so is the power of ecological inference\footnote{A paradigmatic use-case of ecological inference is the estimation of voting trajectories. In this case, $\bm{X_a}$ and $\bm{Y_a}$ would be the votes registered for different candidates at two different elections at each precinct, and $\theta_{akk'}$ would be the fraction of voters from precinct $a$ having voted $k$ at the first election and $k'$ at the later election.}. 
Moreover, we introduce intellectual capital $\bm{I_a}$ and social-intellectual capital $\bm{S_a}$ as covariates for transfers $\theta$ in the model, through a generalized linear model:

\begin{equation}
    \bm{\theta_{ak}} = \text{softmax}\left(\beta_{ak1} + \gamma_{k1} I_{a1} + \delta_{k1} S_{a1}, \dots,\beta_{akK} + \gamma_{kK} I_{aK} + \delta_{kK} S_{aK}\right)
    \label{eq:glm}
\end{equation}

In this expression, $\delta_{k,k'}$ is the effect of the expertise in $k$ (social capital) that is available through the scientists' collaborators on the magnitude of their shift in attention from $k$ to $k'$. Similarly, $\gamma_{kk'}$ is the effect of having more expertise in $k'$ (intellectual capital) on shifting attention from research area $k$ toward research area $k'$. For instance, high values of $\gamma_{kk}$ (the diagonal elements of $\gamma$) would imply that physicists are more conservative toward research areas in which they have comparatively more expertise. The coefficients $\beta_{akk'}$ encode the average behavior of the cohort plus individual deviations to the average behavior that are unexplained by the covariates\footnote{The priors for this hierarchical model are:

\begin{align}
    \beta_{akk'} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{k k'},\sigma_{k k'}) \text{ for } 1\leq k' \leq K-1 \text{ and } \beta_{ak K} = 0\\
    \mu_{k k'} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\alpha \delta_{kk'},1) \text{ (average behavior)}\\
    \delta_{k,k'},\gamma_{k,k'} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)  \text { (effect of co-variates)}
\end{align}
}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{In order to fit the model to the data, we use Stan's Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo sampler (HMC is better behaved than Gibbs sampling for such problems). The variant of the model in \ref{appendix:knowledge} is more complex and a single-point estimate is obtained via gradient-descent instead.}. Of course, other covariates can be considered. To illustrate that, Appendix \ref{appendix:knowledge} 
 introduces variant of the model in which scientists' individual knowledge (represented by a vector in word2vec embeddings space) is used as a covariate, thus allowing to measure uses the effect of specific knowledge on transfers between research areas.

It is important to emphasize a weakness of models of ecological inference, that is, their weak identifiability, as the data only weakly constraints individual values of $\bm{\theta_{ak}}$.  %This warrants some caution when using models such as this one for studying specific individuals (e.g. by inspecting values of $\bm{\theta_{ak}}$ for one individual); the main interest of the model lies in its ability to capture the average effect of certain covariates (e.g. social capital). This weakness converges with the criticism of ecological inference raised by the ``ecological fallacy'' argument \citep{freedman1999ecological} according to which they are limits to what can be inferred about individuals based on aggregate data. 
Nevertheless, this approach i) allows to estimate the average effect of certain variables on transitions between research areas and ii) the Bayesian formulation naturally accounts for the uncertainty associated with limited identifiability.

We have proposed a Bayesian model inspired by models of ecological inference for measuring transfers of attention and knowledge from specific research area to others as well as the effect of different variables on such transfers. This problem, however, can also be viewed as an optimal transport problem \citep{muzellec2017tsallis,li2019learning}. One such problem is the determination of the most-efficient way to  ``transport'' a source distribution (say, $\bm{x}=(x_k)$) to a target distribution (e.g., $\bm{y}=(y_{k'}$)) through transfers $(\theta_{kk'})$ across their components,   given a cost function $\sum_{k,k'} x_{k} \theta_{kk'}C_{kk'}$ (where $C_{kk'}$ is a cost-matrix) \citep{Peyre2018}. This is therefore similar to the Bayesian approach, except that $\theta_{kk'}$ is estimated by minimizing a cost-function instead of a likelihood. This connection is worth noticing because it suggests an ``economic'' interpretation of the re-allocation of research efforts, as well as alternative strategies for modeling transfers across research areas. For instance, at the community level, research efforts are preferably re-allocated among scientists in a way that minimizes learning costs (given each scientist's prior knowledge). Section \ref{sec:optimal-transport} shows how the connection with optimal transport can be leveraged by reverse-engineering an underlying ``cost matrix'', that is shown to be in great part explained by ``learning'' costs (the cost of acquiring new knowledge). This shows that scientific communities adapt in a way that somewhat minimizes learning costs.  %Moreover, optimal transport induces distances between distributions (the distance between a source distribution and a target distribution being the minimal cost of ``transporting'' the former to the latter). As a result, it can be the basis for measures of change or disruption of research agendas.

 \section{\label{sec:results}Results}

 \subsection{\label{sec:macro}General trends}

The proposed model can unveil the trajectories from one research area to another at the macroscopic level, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:sankey}. In this diagram, the width of each flow is proportional to $\sum_a X_{ak}\theta_{akk'}$ (summing over each author $a$), thus directly measuring how much attention was transferred from $k$ to $k'$ at the level of the whole community. The most obvious feature is the overall conservatism of physicists toward their research area, in other words specialization. Another feature is the growth of certain research areas, most notably ``Black holes'' and ``Dark matter''. This is in line with what was hypothesized in the introduction, as years 2010 to 2020 have seen the emergence of new probes of the cosmos. In the mean time, certain research areas have decayed; in particular, ``Neutrinos and flavor physics'' have considerably shrunk. %, as was already suggested in Figure \ref{fig:experiments} which showed the decreasing impact of neutrino experiments. 
On the theoretical side, ``String theory and supergravity'' has also gathered significantly less attention. The macroscopic trends unveiled by the model are also able to explain how exactly certain research areas have grown and to the detriment of which. For instance, the increasing interest in Dark matter seems to be mainly fueled by a shift away from ``Neutrinos and flavor physics'' and ``Electroweak sector''. Similarly, the growth in the interest for AdS/CFT as well as Black holes has happened at the expense of the dedication to ``String theory and supergravity'' research. Interestingly, this provides some credence to physicist Peter Woit's controversial assessment that ``string theorists'' are no longer doing string theory per se, though they keep identifying themselves as string theorists.\footnote{As Peter Woit puts it, citing the 2022 ``Strings'' conference: ``one thing that stands out is that the string theory community has almost completely stopped doing string theory.''; and, ``[presentations' titles] make very clear what the string theory community has found to replace string theory: black holes'' (Woit, 2022, \url{https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=12981}); See also Woit, 2023 ( \url{https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=12401})}

Widths of flows are proportional to $\sum_a X_{ak}\theta_{akk'}$. Insignificant transfers (that happen less than expected by chance alone assuming random mixing) are transparent. }
     \label{fig:sankey}
 \end{figure}

Another finding from these general trends is that smaller research areas such as ``Classical fields'' (which are typically involved in classical gravity or cosmological inflation for instance), ``Dynamics'' or ``Thermodynamics'' seem less cohesive, i.e., they are subject to larger transfers. This suggests that certain bodies of knowledge are linguistically coherent (and therefore appear as clusters of their own with topic modeling) but yet are not able to sustain careers over the long-run by themselves.

% How to explain the size of individual effects? Figure \ref{fig:social-capital-distance} shows the relationship between the effect of social capital on trajectories $k\to k'$ ($\delta_{kk'}$) and the proximity of pairs of topics. The proximity of topics, calculated as the normalized pointwise mutual information between document-topic distributions, is to be roughly understood as the probability for a pair of topics to be associated within a scientific publication. We find a (modest) negative correlation ($R=-0.4$), suggesting that having collaborators with expertise in the target research area is more advantageous when the target area is more remote to one's original expertise. In other words, social capital does help overcome the effects of specialization.

\subsection{\label{sec:magnitude}Quantifying change and the effect of capital}

\subsubsection{Magnitude of change and capital}

Whether individual scientists have remained  conservative toward their research agenda, or have instead significantly revised their priorities, can now be quantitatively measured. To this end, we propose to define a change score $c_a$ for each physicist $a$ as the total variation distance between their initial and late research agendas:

\begin{equation}
    c_a \equiv \mathrm{d}_{\text{TV}}(\bm{x_a},\bm{y_a}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_k |y_{ak}-x_{ak}|
\end{equation}

This score measures how much the research agenda of a scientist has changed between the two time-periods under consideration. It is comprised between 0 (implying that research attention has remained identically distributed) and 1 (implying that the research agenda has changed entirely such that all previously explored research areas were abandoned). The distribution of $c_a$ across authors is given in Figure \ref{fig:change_scores}. Following \citet{Gieryn1978}, we hypothesized that problem change was indeed more often gradual than an abrupt ``migration'' from one research area to another. Figure \ref{fig:change_scores} indeed demonstrates that large values are quite rare, with 50\% of values being comprised between 0.21 and 0.40. However, one must be cautious about interpreting the absolute value of $c_a$. As pointed out by \citet{Gieryn1978}, the extent to which problem change is ``gradual'' depends on the choice of ``cognitive scope'' (the broadness of research areas) and the duration of the time-periods under consideration.  Moreover, we always expect some level of fluctuations in the measured agendas, in part due to noise imputable to the topic model approach for measuring the contribution to each research area. As a result, we never expect $c_a$ to be exactly zero.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{plots/change_score.eps}
    \caption{\textbf{Distribution of change scores in the cohort}. Higher values correspond to more drastic changes in a scientists' research agenda.}    
    \label{fig:change_scores}
\end{figure}

Notwithstanding these subtleties, the change score allows for comparison between physicists. What explains differences in individual strategies? We propose to evaluate the role of several factors, namely: i) the diversity of intellectual capital $D(\bm{I_a})$, based on the Shannon entropy of $\bm{I_a}$; ii) the excess diversity of social capital $D^{\ast}(\bm{S_a})$; and iii) the magnitude of social capital, i.e. $\sum_k S_{ak}$. We also consider iv) the effect of position stability, which we represent as a binary variable $s_a$ such that $s_a=1$ if scientist $a$ has at least one affiliation that spans the whole time range considered, and $s_a=0$ otherwise. We perform a linear regression of $c_a$ as a function of these four variables, controlling for $Z_a=\argmax_{k} x_{ak}$, i.e. physicists' primary research area over the years 2000 to 2009 (see the model specification in Appendix \ref{appendix:change-model}). The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:change_score_effect}.

As can be seen in this figure, the diversity of intellectual capital has a significant positive effect. Physicists with resources in many areas tend to revise their research agenda more. There is also evidence of a positive effect of diversity of social capital on the magnitude of changes in scientists' research focus. The sheer magnitude of social capital (``power''), however, contributes negatively when diversity is taken into account. In other words, ``power'' promotes stability, while ``diversity'' promotes change. It is noteworthy that these dimensions of social capital can have opposite effects. Moreover, position stability has a significant effect as well: physicists with permanent positions are more conservative toward their research agenda. This could be because they have lower incentive to ``adapt'' by committing to trending research problems. It might also be that changes in host institution are often associated with changes in research topics.

Unsurprisingly, both research areas that have shrunk considerably have a significant positive effect on migration score. ``Collider physics'', on the other hand, has a negative effect on the magnitude of change. This is the case \textit{ceteris paribus}; in other words, physicists whose primary category is ``Collider physics'' are more conservative than other physicists with similar capital diversity, power, and position stability. In fact, these physicists also have less diverse capital, and are by far the most conservative, with a change score 20\% lower than the whole cohort on average. It is plausible that the long time-scales of collider experiments and the specialized knowledge that they require provide stable opportunities to physicists in that area (as previously emphasized by \citealt[p.~138]{galison1987how}), thus promoting specialization and conservatism. It must be emphasized that the variance explained is quite low ($R^2=0.15$), and all these factors only play a partial role in the behavior of individuals.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{plots/change_score_effects_entropy_magnitude.eps}
    \caption{\textbf{Effect of measures of intellectual and social capital, and of position stability on the amplitude of changes in high-energy physicists' interests (as measured by the change score $c_a$)}. Diversity is evaluated in terms of the exponential of the Shannon entropy of the distribution of intellectual and social resources physicists possess across research areas. The effect of the primary research area during the initial period (2000-2009) was also included as a control. Three research areas have a significant (95\% CL) effect. Error bars indicate 95\% credible intervals. $R^2=0.15$. Continous variables (capital and change score) are standardized.}
    \label{fig:change_score_effect}
\end{figure}

Using the Stirling index (rather than entropy) as a measure of diversity does not change these results (see Figure \ref{fig:change_score_effect_stirling}, Appendix \ref{appendix:robustness}).

\subsubsection{Diversification of research interests versus consolidation of expertise}

It must be highlighted that the change score $c_a$ gives no indication about the way the research agenda of a scientist has changed. For example, two very opposite strategies may contribute to high values of $c_a$. On the one hand, research agendas can be expanded through the addition of new research areas; we might call such a strategy ``diversification''. On the other hand, research portfolios can be narrowed down, by deserting certain research areas and concentrating increasingly on a core specialization (Figure \ref{fig:research-agenda} illustrates how this can happen, whether via ``conversion'' or ``displacement''). To explore how physicists choose between these two strategies, the effect of each of the considered variables on the probability that they have i) entered at least one new research area in between the two periods or ii) exited one research area (see the specification of the model in Appendix \ref{appendix:enter-exit-model})\footnote{A research area $k$ is considered ``entered'' by $a$ when $x_{ak}<\frac{1}{N}\sum_{a'}x_{a'k}$ and $y_{ak}>\frac{1}{N}\sum_{a'}y_{a'k}$; conversely, a research area is considered exited when $x_{ak}>\frac{1}{N}\sum_{a'}x_{a'k}$ and $y_{ak}<\frac{1}{N}\sum_{a'}y_{a'k}$.}.

% Scientists' tendency toward diversification can be measured by computing the difference between the effective amount of research areas explored in the second and the first time-periods. Mathematically, we define a diversification score $\Delta_a$:

% \begin{equation}
%     \Delta_a \equiv D(\bm{y_a})-D(\bm{x_a})
% \end{equation}

% Where $D$ again denotes the exponential of the Shannon entropy. High values indicate diversification, while negative values indicate consolidation. The absolute values of $\Delta_a$ are not so interesting given that they depend on factors such as the duration of each time-period; for instance, since the second time-period (2015--2019) is shorter than the initial period (2000-2009), the average value of $\Delta_a$ is negative. Nevertheless, this metric allows for comparisons between scientists and for the evaluation of the effect of a number of variable on the choice between diversification and increased specialization.

The effect of capital and position stability on these strategies is shown in Figure \ref{fig:diversification_score_effect}. The diversity of intellectual capital has a strong positive effect on the probability of exiting a research area; intuitively, scientists with diverse interests are more able to dismiss certain research areas. Excess diversity of social capital increases the probability of entering new research areas, but has no discernible effect on the probability of exiting research areas. In contrast, ``power'' significantly decreases the probability of leaving a research area. This suggests than having many collaborators allows to remain committed to many research areas with minimal personal investment, thus stabilizing scientists' research agendas (as previously observed). Moreover, ``power'' also decreases the probability to of entering new research areas; this suggests that powerful scientists have less incentives to invest resources in new topics. String theory \& supergravity has a significant positive effect of both entering and exiting research areas; most likely, many physicists have operated a displacement, by replacing this area with a new one. ``Collider physics'', however, significantly decreases the probability of entering new areas. It might be that the start of the \gls{lhc} has secured this research area for the decades to come. Indeed, the epistemic returns of the \gls{lhc} increase with the amount data collected, and therefore with its operating time. Moreover, the large investments that were necessary for the \gls{lhc} tend to justify that it should be exploited as long as possible in order to make the best out of it. For instance, the HL-LHC project (High-Luminosity \gls{lhc}) is set to upgrade the existing infrastructure in order to increase the rate of proton collisions. At the time of writing, the HL-LHC is expected to start in 2029, which demonstrates the securing effect of the \gls{lhc} for this research area\footnote{(See \url{https://home.cern/science/accelerators/high-luminosity-lhc}).}. Moreover, ``Dark matter'' has a negative effect on the probability of entering a new research area, possibly because scientists with prior commitment to this research area had less incentive to diversify their research portfolio and more incentive to focus increasingly on this topic given its increasing success over the following years. Again, all these conclusions hold as an alternative measure of diversity is considered (\ref{appendix:robustness}, Figure \ref{fig:diversification_score_stirling}).

\subsubsection{When capital matters}

Generally, the diversity of cognitive resources (whether embodied by scientists or accessible through their social network) promotes change. To see how this happens, it is useful to look into the detail of how intellectual capital (as represented by $\bm{I_a}$, the proficiency of researchers in each research area) affects trajectories. For that, we use the model introduced in Section \ref{sec:model}. In this model, the effect of intellectual diversity is directly measured by the diagonal coefficients of the $\gamma$ matrix that measure the effect of having intellectual resources in a certain area on further committing to this area. The matrix is shown in Figure \ref{fig:intellectual-capital-effect}. Most coefficients on the diagonal are significantly greater than zero, thus suggesting that physicists with a strong specialization in a research area have a higher tendency to consolidate their specialization in this area. Several explanations can be suggested. One of them is that having more expertise in an area gives physicists an advantage over their ``competitors'' that they seek to exploit as much as possible.%Another explanation might be that being specialized into one area makes it harder to seize opportunities in other areas.

The effect of social capital on transfers from one research area to another, given by the matrix $\delta_{kk'}$ (see equation \ref{eq:glm}), is shown in Figure \ref{fig:social-capital-effect}. As it appears in this figure, statistically significant effects are always positive. This implies that having many collaborators with expertise in a target area generally increases the likelihood of redirecting attention toward this area, as hypothesized. 


\begin{figure}[h]
\hspace{-2em}
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}

\label{fig:test}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:social-capital-effect} shows that social capital matters more for certain shifts from specific research areas to others, which begs the question: what might explain these variations? In their work on research portfolio diversification, \citet{Tripodi2020} found that ``social-relatedness'' (i.e. whether scientists have immediate access to a sub-field via a collaborator) mattered increasingly as scientists move further away from their specialization. In what follows, an attempt is made to reproduce this finding. To this end, we build a matrix $\nu_{k'|k}\in\{0,1\}$ such that $\nu_{k'|k}$ is the fraction of physicists with more expertise than average in a research area $k'$ among those that have more expertise than average in $k'$ -- as measured in terms of their intellectual capital $(I_{ak})$. We find that $\nu_{k'|k}$ has a significantly negative effect $\beta_\nu$ on $\delta_{kk'}$ ($P(\beta_\nu\geq 0)<5\times 10^{-4}$), with $\delta_{kk'}$ decreasing by 0.88 standard deviation on average as $\nu_{k'|k}$ goes from 0 (nobody holds expertise in both research areas $k$ and $k'$) to 1 (everyone with expertise in $k$ has expertise in $k'$). In other words, the more frequent it is for scientists to hold expertise in both $k$ and $k'$, the less their collaborators' cognitive resources in $k'$ contribute to enhancing shifts in research attention from $k$ to $k'$, as observed by \citet{Tripodi2020}.

\subsection{\label{sec:optimal-transport}Adaptation and learning costs}

We proposed an ecological inference model for unveiling transfers of attention across research areas and the effect of various variables on such transfers at the level of individuals. Here, we leverage the similarity between ecological inference and optimal transport \citep{muzellec2017tsallis,li2019learning} to demonstrate that the shifts of attention observed in the cohort tend (to some extent) to minimize ``learning costs''. 

Let $\bm{x}=\sum_a \bm{x_a}$ be the cohort's initial distribution of attention across research areas (summing over each author $a$), and $\bm{y}=\sum_a \bm{y_a}$ the late distribution. $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{y}$ can be considered ``fixed'' by laboratories, scientific leaders, and funding agencies who define scientific priorities throughout time. In order to achieve $\bm{y}$ given $\bm{x}$, some scientists must redirect their attention away from certain research areas (for which $y_k<x_k$) toward more pressing ones (for which $y_k>x_k$). What is the most efficient way to accomplish the transition from $\bm{x}$ to $\bm{y}$? Intuitively, it is more efficient to achieve the transition in a way that minimizes learning costs, or in other words, in a way that requires fewer scientists to acquire new knowledge. This can be framed as an optimal transfer problem. Let $T_{kk'}$ be the coupling matrix that encodes how much attention has been shifted from one research area $k$ toward a research area $k'$. There are two constraints on $T_{kk'}$: $\sum_{k'} T_{kk'} = x_k$ and $\sum_{k} T_{kk'} = y_{k'}$. But $T$ must also minimize learning costs $C$, which are assumed to be linear in $T$: $C=\sum_{k,k'}T_{kk'}C_{kk'}$, where $C_{kk'}$ is a cost-matrix. The problem of finding the couplings $T_{kk'}$ that minimize the ``transportation'' costs (given the cost matrix $C_{kk'}$) is an instance of discrete Monge–Kantorovich optimal transport problem \citep{Peyre2018}. Our problem is the opposite: the couplings are known, and we must infer back the underlying cost matrix. Indeed, the trajectory model in Section \ref{sec:model} allowed us to recover the transfers from a research area $k$ to $k'$ for each individual, which are simply $x_{ak}\theta_{akk'}$. Summing over individuals, we obtain the coupling matrix $T_{kk'}=\sum_a x_{ak} \theta_{akk'}$, which measures how much attention was shifted away from $k$ and toward $k'$ at the level of the cohort.

The problem of recovering the cost matrix given the couplings is called the inverse optimal transport problem. \citet{Chu2021} proposed a method to solve it in the discrete case. This method requires to put a prior on $P(C_{kk'})$ -- indeed, there are infinitely many cost matrices that can yield the same optimum, and priors are needed to lift this degeneracy. We therefore assume $C_{kk'}\sim \mathcal{N}(\beta \times (1-\nu_{k'|k}),1)$, where $\nu_{k'|k}$ is the fraction of physicists who already held expertise in $k'$ among those who already held expertise in $k$, and $\beta\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is the contribution of learning costs. If $\nu_{k'|k}=1$ then no scientist shifting attention from $k$ to $k'$ would need to acquire new knowledge, and indeed $\mathbb{E}(C_{kk'})=0$. If $\nu_{k'|k}=0$, any scientist shifting from $k$ toward $k'$ must acquire new knowledge, and the cost is maximal ($\mathbb{E}(C_{kk'})=\beta$). If the observed behavior \textit{does} minimize learning costs, we should observe a strong correlation between $C_{kk'}$ and $1-\nu_{k'|k}$.  Using the Metropolis-Hastings approach proposed in \citealt{Chu2021} together with our own choice of priors, we are able to recover $C_{kk'}$ -- the underlying cost matrix -- and we find $R(C_{kk'},1-\nu_{k'|k})=0.77$ (where $R$ is the Pearson correlation), such that $R^2=0.59$. As expected, learning costs contribute very significantly to the recovered cost matrix. Under changing circumstances, scientific norms and institutions provide incentives for scientists to adapt in a way that minimizes global learning costs.

\subsection{\label{sec:cases}Exploring individual careers}

It is insightful to examine scientists at both extremes of the distribution of change scores in Figure \ref{fig:change_scores}. Tables \ref{table:low_change} and \ref{table:top_change} show the 10 physicists with the lowest and the highest change scores ($c_a$). Measures of the diversity of each physicist's intellectual capital $D(\bm{I_a})$ and social capital $D(\bm{S_a})$ are included. Table \ref{table:low_change} shows the physicists that have been most conservative toward their research agenda. Strikingly, 8 out of 10 are specialized in ``Collider physics'', in line with the above observation that this particular research area is more specialized.
% ``Neutrinos and flavor physics'' occurs several times as well. This might seem contradicting with the finding that this research area is associated with higher change scores. However, Neutrinos physics remains a significant research area to which many physicists are still committed. For instance, S.~Goswami's started her career in the late 1990s, working on neutrinos oscillations \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srubabati_Goswami}} and has remained dedicated to this research area after what she describes as the ``golden age'' of neutrino physics (i.e. the early 2000s, \footnote{\url{https://www.ias.ac.in/public/Resources/Initiatives/Women_in_Science/Contributors/srubabati.pdf}}).
%Moreover, although the investigation of the ``Electroweak sector'' has mostly relied on particle accelerators, it is noteworthy that physicists specialized in the former research area have more effectively taken the turn to the investigation of Dark matter. This suggests that converting knowledge of the phenomenology of the the electroweak sector to the study of dark matter is easier than re-adapting knowledge specific to particle accelerators to this end. 

Table \ref{table:top_change} shows the 10 physicists with the highest change scores.  Looking into the share of attention dedicated by each scientist to each area, one can see that high change scores are usually reached, unsurprisingly, when physicists exit a research area and enter a new one in which they had almost no prior interest. %There is one exception: physicist M.~A.~Luty is shown to have a high change score, and yet his principal research area has remained identical. In this case, the change score is presumably high because this physicist has abandoned several research areas to which he previously contributed, to focus instead on physics of the Electroweak sector. In other words, this physicist has \textit{consolidated} his prior specialization into one research area, by ``disengaging'' \citep{Gieryn1978} from other commitments.

In order to make sure that these cases of high migration were not false positives due to the failure to properly disambiguate authors, we have inspected each of them manually, by comparing physicists' Inspire HEP profiles with data from their personal websites, as well as their university or LinkedIn profiles. We found that only one of them to be a false positive due to failing author disambiguation, namely ``T.~Fuchs'', i.e. the author with the highest change score. All other cases are accurate.
%For instance, physicist M.~Redi can be seen to have moved away from Quantum gravity research toward the investigation of Dark matter. And indeed, his personal web-page reads: ``I have worked in several different fields of theoretical physics from extra-dimensional theories to supersymmetry and modifications of gravity. My main interest at the moment is phenomenology but I keep interests in more formal subjects such us strongly coupled dynamics [\dots] I am currently mostly working on cosmology, dark matter theories and gravitational waves'' \footnote{\url{https://sites.google.com/site/redi76/research}, accessed on 11/10/2023}.
For instance, on G.~Ferretti's university webpage, one can read: ``Gabriele Ferretti joined Chalmers in 1999. For the first ten years he has been mainly involved in research in quantum field theory and string theory with emphasis on their formal aspects. Since the start of the LHC he has also become interested in phenomenological applications of quantum field theory and model building'' \footnote{\url{https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/ferretti/}, accessed on 11/10/2023}.
%In the case of Bin.~Wu, interestingly, the model has successfully captured his shift to Collider physics, even though most  keywords in his publications have remained consistent\footnote{\url{https://inspirehep.net/authors/983139}}. This suggests our approach is able to detect the research area to which certain knowledge is being applied (e.g. fundamental \gls{qcd} vs \gls{qcd} applied to the physics of hadron colliders). Upon closer inspection, however, S.~D.~Katz's change score is overstated due to early publications focusing on \gls{qcd} being incorrectly classified as not belonging to Phenomenology-HEP.

Comparing tables \ref{table:low_change} and \ref{table:top_change}, one can see that physicists with high change scores tend to have much more diverse intellectual and social capital. In other words, such physicists have had more opportunities to adapt or revise their research agenda. This is in line with the observation that change is enhanced by the diversity of cognitive resources one has access to.

The model of physicists trajectories introduced in Section \ref{sec:model} can also unveil physicists that made the sharpest turns from one specific research area to another. For instance, the two physicists that made the most significant turn from Neutrinos physics to Dark matter are shown in Figure \ref{fig:turns_neutrinos_dm}. Physicist A's personal website reads: ``I am working on particle astrophysics and cosmology. In particular, \textit{I am interested in dark matter problem in the Universe, and how to probe it using annihilation products such as energetic gamma rays and neutrinos}. [\dots]  I \textit{started my research career by studying supernova neutrinos from various aspects} [our emphases].''\footnote{\url{https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/s.ando/eng/Research.html}}. In this example, there is therefore a clear indication of the ``conversion'' of prior knowledge to new purposes, one of the forms of change drawn from historical institutionalism represented schematically in Figure \ref{fig:research-agenda}. Similarly, Physicist B started his career in Neutrino Physics with a PhD on the ``Semiclassical Analysis of Solar Neutrino Data''.  His personal webpage reads: ``My main research interests lie at the intersection of the fields of astrophysics, particle physics, and nuclear physics, concerning mostly neutrinos and the weak interactions. In the past several years, there has been strong growth at this intersection, in part due to new results from the ongoing experiments.''\footnote{\url{https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/beacom.7/}}. Moreover, Physicist A claims that ``Although [he is] a theoretical astrophysicist, [he] always consider prospects of current or near future generation of experiments and telescopes.''. This demonstrates that experiments create opportunities that physicists can try to seize by building upon their prior knowledge.

Similarly, Figure \ref{fig:turns_strings_bh} shows the trajectories of the two physicists with the most striking turn from String theory and supergravity to Black holes. Physicist C has seemingly exited String theory to focus on Black holes (which was already part of his research agenda) but also AdS/CFT; this is therefore an emblematic example of the trend discussed above. Physicist D is a more senior scientist toward the end of his career, with fewer publications in the late period.

\subsection{\label{sec:outcomes}Outcomes of changes in research focus}

Physicists' behavior is determined by their opportunities (and therefore their capital) but also by the incentives they receive to either pursue research in certain areas or instead switch to more rewarding problems. One way to assess which directions physicists are ``encouraged'' to take is by looking into the pay-offs (in terms of, say, scientific credit) associated with different trajectories. Outcomes also provide information about whether certain strategies have been more ``successful'' than others; e.g., whether the benefits of specialization outweighed those of seizing other opportunities. This section compares outcomes of various trajectories in terms of citations. Citations very imperfectly measure the epistemic value of published work; however, they are relevant for scientists' careers. 

To evaluate the effect of trajectories on scientists' performance, partial h-indices $h_a^{I}$ and $h_a^{F}$ are calculated for each scientist $a$ of the cohort, based on the citations they received for the papers that they published during the initial (2000--2009) and final (2015-2019) time-periods only. It is assumed that the late success of scientists, measured by $h_a^{F}$, is a linear function of: i) their initial performance $h_a^{I}$; ii) their academic age; iii) $\bm{x_a}$, i.e. their research agenda during the initial period; and finally, iv) the transfers in research attention, as measured by $\bm{x_a}$ and $(\theta_{akk'})$.

% \begin{align}
%     h_a^{I} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{a}^I,\sigma^I)\\
%     h_a^{F} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{a}^F ,\sigma^F)\\
%     \Pi_a &= (h_a^{I}-\mu_{a}^I)/\sigma^I \\
%     \mu_{a}^I &= \mu^I + \alpha \text{age}_a + \sum_{k}\gamma_k x_{ak}\\
%     \mu_{a}^F &= \mu^F  + \beta \Pi_a +\sum_{k,k'}\eta_{kk'}x_{ak}\theta_{akk'}\\
% \end{align}

The effect of $x_{ak}\theta_{akk'}$ (how much attention was transferred from research $k$ to $k'$) on the h-index outcome is assumed to be of the form $\eta_{kk'} = \phi_{k'} + \psi_{kk'}$ such that $\phi_{k'}$ is the bonus associated with the exploration of research area $k'$ in the second time-period, and $\psi_{kk'}$ is the bonus associated with having shifted research resources from $k$ to $k'$ (which can be negative if, say, knowledge from $k$ turned out not so relevant in the context of $k'$). The estimate of $\eta_{kk'}$ allows us to compare contra-factual scenarios. For instance, the quantity $\eta_{kk'}-\eta_{kk}$ measures how much the h-index is increased (or decreased) by switching from one research area to another instead of pursuing the same research area. The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:outcomes_rho}. Only five trajectories have a significant effect. It appears that scientists who exit String theory \& supergravity to investigate ``Black holes'', ``Dark matter'' or ``Cosmology'' fared better than those who committed to String theory \& supergravity. Similarly, scientists who exited ``Neutrinos \& flavour physics'' to pursue ``Dark matter'' or ``Cosmology'' have had better outcomes. Although no individual effect involved in leaving ``Dark matter'' for other research area is found to be significant, it seems that generally, there is more evidence that exiting ``Dark matter'' leads to worse outcomes. In fact, as many physicists exited these two research areas (String theory and Neutrino physics), it is understandable that publications on these topics receive less citations.

By construction, diagonal coefficients are thus zero. Asterisks indicate statistical significance at the 95\% credible-level. }

\section{Discussion}

This paper addressed the conflict between conservatism in science (as a mean to better exploit prior knowledge), and the imperative for adaptation in a changing epistemic landscape. To this end, a novel unsupervised Bayesian approach for studying the effect of various variables on changes in scientists' research portfolios was developed and applied to a cohort of $N=2,195$ high-energy physicists between 2000 and 2019. The proposed model is enrooted in the intuition that shifts from one research area to another involve transfers of knowledge and cumulative strategies of incremental changes. The model simultaneously allows to measure transfers of knowledge across research areas at the macroscopic level, while measuring the effect of various variables on individual trajectories. In particular, following Bourdieu, our model implemented the effect of two of the scientists' major assets for adapting to changing circumstances, namely intellectual and social capital.


% A connection was drawn between this phenomenon and that of institutional change under changing circumstances, by leveraging the typology of incremental change from historical institutionalism (``layering'', ``conversion'', ``displacement'', etc.) which suggests strategies through which scientists can progressively revise their research to navigate these two conflicting imperatives.



% A Bayesian model of changes in scientists' research portofolio was proposed on this basis.

At the macroscopic level, the model unveiled the decline of neutrinos physics as a result of a massive transfer to dark matter and electroweak sector. Conversely, it revealed a significant shift away from the electroweak sector toward dark matter. Moreover, string theory \& supergravity has been found to be disintegrating into black holes and AdS/CFT research.

Beyond these general trends, the relationship between capital and change in scientists' interests was also explored. The diversity of intellectual and social resources was found to be positively associated with change, while ``power'' (i.e. the magnitude of social capital) and institutional stability are associated with more stability and conservatism in research interests. Increased intellectual capital in certain research areas is associated with stronger commitments toward these research areas. Moreover, social capital was found to have a stronger effect on transfers between more cognitively distant areas, in line with \citealt{Tripodi2020}.

Disparaties among research area were found. ``Collider physics'' is an especially conservative research area, possibly as the result of the long time-scales of particle colliders such as the \gls{lhc}. There is also evidence that physicists specialized in dark matter have been consolidating their specialization, presumably since the increasing popularity of the topic encouraged them to ``double-down'' their investment in this research area.

In order to sharpen our understanding of these results and to further explore the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methodology, individual cases of interests were explored.  Except for a couple problematic instances (one due to failed name disambiguation, one due to the limit of the classification system of the database used in this paper), this provided support for the previous findings. Four cases emblematic of i) the migration from neutrinos to dark matter and ii) the migration from string theory and supergravity to black Holes were also analyzed. These examples supported the ability of the proposed approach to detect such transfers of knowledge. The two cases emblematic of the shift from neutrinos to dark matter suggest the role of new experimental opportunities in change in scientific interests.

Finally, the outcomes of transfers from one research area to another were also studied, by measuring the effect of the research agenda distribution and transfers between research areas  on authors' success (in terms of citations). Evidence was found of a positive effect of exiting Neutrino physics and String theory for Dark matter and Cosmology (and also Black holes in the case of String theory). This suggest that there has indeed been an incentive to turn to these research areas, and/or that scientists with expertise in these area (Strings and Neutrinos) were ``successful'' in taking this turn.

% \subsection{Discussion}

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Diversity vs power
%     \item Specialization vs conservatism/stability. Risk management. 
%     \item Evidence for gradual structure of change? Need more results!
%     \item \citep{muzellec2017tsallis} OT at the community level
% \end{itemize}

Throughout the paper, various limitations of this contribution were raised. The first limitation pertains to the lack of representativeness of the cohort; yet, it does seem that decisions about data-inclusion can influence conclusions \citep{Aleta2019}. Another issue is the arbitrariness in the choice of cognitive scope considered for studying ``change'', as was already noticed by \citet{Gieryn1978}. Previous works (e.g. \citealt{Tripodi2020,Aleta2019,Battiston2019,Jia2017}) have typically relied upon the hierarchical \gls{pacs} classification of physics literature, such that the cognitive scales were imposed. Using a topic model instead, enables to choose the cognitive scale ``at will'', at least in principle (with potential computational caveats). For this work, the literature was divided into 16 topics that captured the features of change in the epistemic landscape discussed above, i.e. the rise of new probes of the cosmos, but other scales could have been considered. %Another issue with this methodology is related to the model for scientists' trajectories. Models of ecological inference, technically speaking, estimate joint distributions from marginal distributions \citep{muzellec2017tsallis}, but in fact many joint distributions can yield the same marginals. We phrased this issue as a matter of ``weak identifiability'' or, in social science terms, as the ``ecological fallacy'' \citep{freedman1999ecological}. However, the proposed model includes many predictors (each dimension of intellectual and social capital) compared to most models of ecological inference found in the social science literature, thus increasing identifiability; moreover, this issue of weak-identifiability is not as a serious threat for the estimation of the effect of these predictors than it is for the estimate of particular transfers of knowledge at the level of individuals.

%  \section{Scientific exploration as an optimal transfer problem}

% High underdetermination in high-energy physics: need to seeks constraints other than empirical to guide theory.
% Empircal evidence alone cannot explain scientists behavior in rational terms.
% What are other constraints that make rational behavior possible?

% The problem for the scientific community as a whole is to allocate labor in a why that maximizes progress (regardless of how progress is measured). This is, to some extent, a problem of collective action. To address this problem, the scientific community is tooled with institutions and norms that effectively constrain scientists or incentivize them to have certain behaviors. For instance, the question of ``pursuit'' (what should be investigated by the scientists) is not just a question about the behavior to be adopted by whole communities; it is about what individual scientists should do. For instance, scientific institutions might encourage scientists to be opportunistic, by seeking to minimize certain costs and to reach low-hanging fruits when possible. This might enhance the efficiency of whole communities.


% \section{Modeling knowledge}

% The goal is to model the knowledge of individual scientists using abstracts of the scientific literature. In particular, for a given author $a$, we want to estimate the probability $p_{aw}$ that $a$ ``knows'' a particular concept $w$ (a word/n-gram with semantic content). The ultimate goals are to:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Estimate to what extent any pair of scientist is able to understand each other (e.g. by computing their common knowledge $S_{aa'}=\sum_w p_{aw}p_{a'w}$).
%     \item Infer which scientists are more likely to investigate certain domains given their previous knowledge.
%     \item Finally, observe the effect of the ``costs'' of learning (which are an obstacle to entering new domains of knowledge), and how scientists  circumvent such costs through collaborations, by modeling individual trajectories in the semantic space.
% \end{itemize}

% This is challenging because:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The notion of knowledge is vague. In the following we propose the following broad definition: $a$ knows a concept $w$ if they are presumably able to use this concept in a publication.
%     \item Abstracts are very short and only reflect a small portion of the scientists' knowledge.
% \end{itemize}

% Below we sketch a strategy for inferring $p_{aw}$ in spite of these challenges.

% \subsection{Exploiting occurrences}

% The first thing we can do is notice that occurrence of words in abstracts yields useful information. First, of course, $p_{ak}|n_{aw}>0=1$. Indeed, from our definition of knowledge, scientists that use a concept $w$ (at least in solo-authored publications) \textit{must} know $w$. However, the absence of a word from an abstract only yields moderate information about $p_{aw}$. We can control how much by modeling the probability that a concept $w$ occurs $n_{aw}=k$ times in the works of $a$ as:

% \begin{equation}
%     P(n_{aw}=k) = \begin{cases} 
%       (1-f_{aw})^{N_a}p_{aw} + (1-p_{aw}) & \text{ if } k=0 \\
%       \binom{N_a}{k} f_{aw}^k(1-f_{aw})^{N_a-k} p_{aw}  & \text{ if } k>0
%    \end{cases}
% \end{equation}

% Where $f_w$ is the term-frequency of $w$ among publications from authors that know $w$. Then, the absence of a word can be attributed to lower values of $f_w$. This requires a prior distribution for $f_w$. Priors can be set by comparing the frequency of each word to the typical fraction of people in the scientific community that are expected to ``know'' the concept.

% \begin{equation}
%     f_{aw} = 
% \end{equation}

% \subsection{Exploiting semantic relationships}

% Given the keywords a scientist has used, how to determine which keywords they might plausibly know as well, among those they have not used?

% The idea is to exploit semantic relationships among keywords (concepts) by recognizing that the knowledge of certain words $w$ imply (plausibly or necessarily) the knowledge of other keywords $w'$. For instance, knowing what a ``Higgs boson'' is, implies knowledge of what ``bosons'' are, as well as of what ``particles'' are. To infer the nature of the relationship between keywords we learn ``keyword''-embeddings, i.e. a dense vector representation $\mathbf{v}_w$ of each keyword $w$, which captures the probability that these keywords co-occur. The underlying intuition is the following: if it is highly probable that a keyword $i$ is followed by a keyword $j$, then it is highly probable that the knowledge of $i$ requires the knowledge of $j$. The probability that $j$ follows $i$ in a document is:

% \begin{equation}
%     P_{i\to j} = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{v}_i\cdot \mathbf{v}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{v}_i\cdot \mathbf{v}_{V})_{j}
% \end{equation}

% Different strategies are possible:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Learning ``knowledge embeddings'' $\mathbf{S}_a$, such that, say, $p_{aw}=\text{logit}^{-1}(\mathbf{S}_a \cdot \mathbf{v}_w)$. The advantage is that this is technically and computationally easy, and that this preserves the semantic space from our keywords embeddings. It is however not clear whether this can capture the interdependencies encoded in the matrix $P_{i\to j}$. The model might learn embeddings that ``overfit'' in a way that does not preserve the expected regularities.
%     \item We might also notice that the transition matrix $P_{i\to j}$ defines a Markov process. From that we can derive hitting times $\tau_{i\to j}$. Then we might assume that the probability to know $j$ given the knowledge of $i$ ($p_{aj}|p_{ai}$) is a function of the hitting times $\tau_{i\to j}$, if $P_{i\to j}$ is dense enough. For sparse transition matrices, we might instead exploit hitting probabilities. Keywords $j$ that are part of common knowledge are such that  $\tau_{i\to j}$ is relatively small for most $i$.
%     \item By clustering keywords in a tree such that if a word $w$ is attributed to a node that is an ancestor of the node attribute to $w'\neq w$, then the knowledge of $w'$ implies that of $w$. The problem then reduces to finding a tree that preserves the semantic relationship encoded by the transition matrix $P_{i\to j}$ which is not trivial. The tree-like structure conveys our intuition of a hierarchical relationship between certain concepts, however, it is unclear how nodes that are siblings (say) should be correlated.

% \end{itemize}



% \subsection{Knowledge embeddings}

% Each author is attributed a knowledge vector $\mathbf{S}_{a}$ such that $P(K_{aw}=1)$ (the probability that an author $a$ knows a concept $w$) is:

% \begin{equation}
%     P(K_{aw}=1) = \text{logit}^{-1} (\mathbf{v}_w \cdot \mathbf{S}_{a}) = p_{aw}
% \end{equation}

% This probability measure is valid if:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item if $p_{aw}$ high and $d(\mathbf{v}_w,\mathbf{v}_{w'})$ is small then $p_{aw'}$ must be high too.
% \end{itemize}


% From this we can build a measure of the common knowledge between any pair of scientists $(a,a')$:

% \begin{equation}
%     C(a,a') = \sum_w p_{aw}p_{a'w}
% \end{equation}

% \begin{equation}
%     \dfrac{e^b}{(C-1)+e^b} = s
% \end{equation}

% \begin{equation}
%     e^b = s(C-1) + se^b
% \end{equation}

% \begin{equation}
%     e^b(1-s) = s(C-1)
% \end{equation}

% \begin{equation}
%     e^b = s(C-1)/(1-s)
% \end{equation}

% Specialization results from the need to share knowledge among scientists. We assume specialization organizes knowledge in a hierachical, tree-like manner. As a result, each domain of knowledge is itself divided into $n$ sub-domains. It is assumed that, in order to have knowledge of a sub-domain, one must also have knowledge of its parent knowledge domain. The variables of interest are:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item $S_{az}$, the depth of the knowledge that $a$ has of a domain $z$.
%     \item $d_{wz}$, the depth of knowledge of a concept $w$ of $z$, i.e. the level of specialization in $z$ that is needed in order to know $w$.
% \end{itemize}

% We further assume that $\phi_{wz}$, the frequency of $w$ in the context $z$, is, per the tree-like structure, $\propto 1/n^d$. That is also roughly the fraction of people who know it, among those that have a deep knowledge of $z$, assuming strong specialization (i.e., scientists only ``know'' $\sim 1$ of the domains of depth $d$).

% The probability that $a$ understands a concept $w_z$ ($P(K_{a,w,z}=1)$) is:

% \begin{equation}
%     P(K_{a,w,z}=1|S_{a,z}=s) = \alpha \dfrac{1}{n^d_{wz}} f(s,d_{wz}) = \alpha \phi_{w,z} f(s,d_{wz})
% \end{equation}

% Where $f(S_{az},d_{wz})$ goes to zero if $S_{az}=s<d_{wz}$, i.e. the depth of knowledge of $a$ is too small. One could model $f$ through a step-function. $\alpha$ is some constant that depends on the typical sparsity of the knowledge of the tree.

% \begin{equation}
%     P(S_{az}=s|K_{awz}=1) = \dfrac{P(K_{awz}=1|S_{az}=s)P(S_{az}=s)}{P(K_{awz}=1)} = \dfrac{ f(s,d_{wz})\exp^{-s/\lambda}}{\int_0^{+\infty} f(s',d_{wz})\exp^{-s'/\lambda} ds' }
% \end{equation}

% Let us now assume that $w_z$ occurs in an article $d$, and let $A_d = \{a'\}$ be its authors. Than at least one of the authors must know $w$. The probability that at least one of them know the word is:

% \begin{equation}
%     1-\prod_{a'} P(K_{a'wz=0}) = 1-\prod_{a'} \left(1- \alpha \phi_{w,z} f(s,d_{wz})\right)
% \end{equation}

% This probability allows to use the occurrence of $w$ in a document to inform the distribution of $P(S_{az}=s)$ of all its authors. Solo-authored papers are of course much more informative.

\subsection{\label{appendix:topics}Topics}

\subsubsection{\label{appendix:keywords}Keyword classification}

Whether a keyword has been applied to a particular research area $k$ can be better decided by leveraging information from the context.

In order to recover the topic associated with each occurrence of a word, we first evaluate the probability $P(z_{di}=k|w_{di},\bm{\theta}_{d})$ that keyword $i$ in document $d$ belongs to each topic $k$, given $\bm{\theta}_d$, the topic distribution of $d$. We then assign the most probable value to $z_{di}$:

\begin{equation}
    z_{di} := \argmax_{k=1,\dots,K} P(z_{di}=k|w_{di},\bm{\theta}_{d}) =  \argmax_{k=1,\dots,K} \dfrac{P(w_{di}|z_{di}=k)P(z_{di}=k|\bm{\theta}_d)}{P(w_{di}|\bm{\theta}_d)}
\end{equation}

In the process, we discard ambiguous keywords for which $H(z_{di})\geq \log{2}$, where $H$ denotes the entropy of the distribution $P(z_{di}=k|w_{di})$. Either such keywords do not carry any scientific content, or the context is insufficient to disambiguate among the possible research areas to which they might belong.

    k_a &= \argmax_k x_{ak}\\
    \beta,\mu &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\
    |\mu^{\text{area}}_k| &\sim \mathrm{Exponential}(\tau)\\

% \section{\label{appendix:macro}Macroscopic transfers}

\subsection{\label{appendix:knowledge}Supplementary model: measuring the effect of specific knowledge on transfers between research areas}

The model introduced in Section \ref{sec:model} can be modified to incorporate any kind of covariate. To illustrate this, this section proposes a model where the covariate $\bm{Z_a}$ is a vector in the word-embedding space that represents the knowledge of each physicist. The goal of this model is to get a better understanding of what bits of knowledge have increased the ability/tendency of physicists to leave certain research areas for others. 

The knowledge vector is constructed as follows. A bag-of-keywords $b_{aw}$ is constructed based on the abstracts of each scientist' publications, excluding those with more than two authors. $b_{aw}$ defined as the amount of times author $a$ has used the keyword $w$ in abstracts of their publications. Only keywords that carry specialized knowledge (i.e., those whose topic probability distribution entropy is lesser than $\log 2$) are included. A tf-idf transformation is then applied to the bag-of-words, resulting in a new matrix $b'_{aw}$. Finally, the knowledge vector is the mean embedding calculated form the transformed bag-of-words:

\begin{equation}
    \bm{Z_{a}} = \dfrac{\sum_w b'_{aw} \bm{v_{w}}}{\sum_w b'_{aw}} 
\end{equation}

Where $\bm{v_w}\in\mathbb{R}^{50}$ is the embedding of keyword $w$ (using the same embeddings as those used for training the topic model). 

Equation \eqref{eq:glm} from Section \ref{sec:model} is then modified as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \bm{\theta_{ak}} = \text{softmax}\left(\beta_{ak1} + \bm{\gamma_{k1}}\cdot \bm{Z_{a}}, \dots,\beta_{akK} +  \bm{\gamma_{kK}}\cdot \bm{Z_{a}} \right)
\end{equation}

The vectors $\gamma_{kk'}$ are learned via gradient-descent on the log-likelihood of the model.

Keywords $w$ that maximize the probability to leave $k$ for $k'$ are those that maximize $(\text{idf}(w) \bm{v_w}) \cdot (\bm{\gamma_{kk'}}-\sum_{i \neq k'}\bm{\gamma_{ki}})$. These are shown in Table \ref{table:largest_transfers}.
Keywords that maximize the commitment to $k$ are those that maximize $ (\text{idf}(w) \bm{v_w}) \cdot (\bm{\gamma_{kk}}-\sum_{k' \neq k}\bm{\gamma_{kk'}})$. They are shown in Table \ref{table:most_conservative}.
